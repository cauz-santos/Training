## Week 1: Foundations of Bioinformatics and Genomic Data Handling

### Day 3: Sequence Alignment and Dot Plot Analysis (using R)

Day 3 will delve into the fundamental concepts of biological sequences and their comparison. Understanding DNA, RNA, and protein sequences is paramount in bioinformatics, as they are the raw data for most analyses. We will then explore how to visualize sequence similarities and differences using dot plot analysis, with a hands-on session in R.

**Morning Session: Basics of DNA, RNA, and Protein Sequences**

This session will provide a foundational understanding of the different types of biological sequences and their significance in molecular biology and genomics.

**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): The Blueprint of Life**

*   **Structure:** DNA is a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).
*   **Base Pairing:** A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G (Chargaff\'s rules). This complementary base pairing is crucial for DNA replication and repair.
*   **Function:** DNA carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. It serves as the long-term storage of genetic information.
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** DNA sequences are typically represented as strings of A, T, C, G characters.

**RNA (Ribonucleic Acid): The Messenger and More**

*   **Structure:** RNA is typically single-stranded and contains ribose sugar instead of deoxyribose. It has Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T), so A pairs with U, and C pairs with G.
*   **Types and Functions:**
    *   **mRNA (messenger RNA):** Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis.
    *   **tRNA (transfer RNA):** Carries specific amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.
    *   **rRNA (ribosomal RNA):** A structural component of ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs.
    *   **Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs):** A diverse group of RNAs with regulatory and catalytic functions (e.g., microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs).
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** RNA sequences are represented as strings of A, U, C, G characters.

**Proteins: The Workhorses of the Cell**

*   **Structure:** Proteins are complex macromolecules made up of chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. There are 20 common amino acids, each with a unique side chain.
*   **Levels of Structure:** Proteins fold into specific three-dimensional structures (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) that determine their function.
*   **Function:** Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions (enzymes), DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules.
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** Protein sequences are represented as strings of single-letter amino acid codes (e.g., A for Alanine, L for Leucine).

**The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology:**

DNA -> RNA -> Protein. This fundamental concept describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. Bioinformatics plays a critical role in analyzing and understanding each step of this process.

**Afternoon Session: Dot Plot Analysis for Sequence Comparisons (Hands-on in R)**

Dot plot analysis is a simple yet powerful graphical method for comparing two biological sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) to identify regions of similarity, repeats, inversions, and deletions. It provides a visual representation of sequence alignment without performing a full, computationally intensive alignment.

**How Dot Plots Work:**

A dot plot is a two-dimensional matrix where one sequence is plotted along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. A dot is placed at coordinates (i, j) if the character at position `i` in the x-axis sequence matches the character at position `j` in the y-axis sequence. Regions of similarity appear as diagonal lines.

*   **Perfect Match:** A single, continuous diagonal line.
*   **Repeats:** Multiple parallel diagonal lines.
*   **Inversions:** Diagonal lines perpendicular to the main diagonal.
*   **Insertions/Deletions:** Shifts or breaks in the diagonal lines.

**Hands-on Practice in R:**

R is a powerful statistical programming language widely used in bioinformatics for data analysis and visualization. We will use R to create dot plots and interpret their patterns.

**Required R Packages:**

We will likely use packages such as `seqinr` or `Biostrings` for sequence manipulation and base R plotting functions, or `ggplot2` for more advanced visualizations.

**Example R Code for Dot Plot Analysis:**

First, ensure you have R and RStudio (optional, but recommended for a user-friendly interface) installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

```R
# Install necessary packages if you haven\'t already
install.packages("seqinr")
# If using Bioconductor packages, you might need:
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#     install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install("Biostrings")

library(seqinr)
# library(Biostrings) # Uncomment if using Biostrings

# Define two example sequences

This comprehensive process ensures that data is effectively transformed from raw input into valuable knowledge that can drive decision-making. Each stage is iterative, and often, insights from later stages can lead to revisiting earlier stages for further refinement.  What specific type of data are you working with, or what kind of problem are you trying to solve? Knowing this can help narrow down the most relevant methods and tools.  




### Day 5: Data QC, Experimental Design, and Review

Day 5 is crucial for understanding the importance of data quality in bioinformatics and how experimental design impacts downstream analysis. We will also have a challenging hands-on session to apply our Linux and HPC knowledge.

**Morning Session 1: Integrative Discussion on Experimental Design and Its Impact on SNP Analysis and RNA-seq**

Before diving into data analysis, it is paramount to understand the principles of good experimental design. A well-designed experiment ensures that the data collected is robust, reliable, and capable of answering the biological questions posed. Poor experimental design can lead to biased results, false conclusions, and wasted resources.

**Key Principles of Experimental Design in Genomics:**

*   **Replication:** Having multiple biological replicates is essential to account for biological variability and to ensure statistical power. Without sufficient replicates, it\'s impossible to distinguish true biological effects from random noise.
*   **Randomization:** Randomly assigning samples to experimental groups or processing order helps to minimize systematic bias.
*   **Blinding:** If possible, blinding researchers to the experimental conditions can prevent unconscious bias during data collection or analysis.
*   **Controls:** Including appropriate positive and negative controls is vital to validate experimental procedures and interpret results correctly.
*   **Sample Size Calculation:** Determining the appropriate number of samples needed to detect a statistically significant effect, considering factors like effect size, variability, and desired statistical power.

**Impact on SNP Analysis:**

For SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) analysis, experimental design considerations include:

*   **Population Structure:** Understanding the genetic relationships within your sample population is critical to avoid spurious associations. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help identify population structure.
*   **Relatedness:** Accounting for relatedness among individuals in a study is important to prevent false positives in association studies.
*   **Coverage:** Sufficient sequencing depth (coverage) is needed to accurately call SNPs and distinguish true variants from sequencing errors.
*   **Allele Frequency:** Rare variants require larger sample sizes to achieve statistical significance.

**Impact on RNA-seq:**

For RNA-seq (RNA sequencing), experimental design considerations include:

*   **Biological vs. Technical Replicates:** Biological replicates (different biological samples under the same condition) are essential for statistical inference. Technical replicates (re-sequencing the same sample) are less critical with modern sequencing technologies but can help assess technical variability.
*   **Sequencing Depth:** Adequate sequencing depth is required to accurately quantify gene expression, especially for lowly expressed genes.
*   **Read Length:** Longer reads can improve alignment accuracy, especially in regions with repetitive sequences or alternative splicing.
*   **Paired-end vs. Single-end:** Paired-end reads provide more information for alignment and transcript assembly, especially for identifying splice junctions.
*   **RNA Quality:** The quality of input RNA significantly impacts RNA-seq results. RNA integrity (e.g., RIN score) should be assessed.

**Discussion Points:**

*   Share examples of good and bad experimental designs you have encountered.
*   Discuss the challenges of experimental design in real-world biological research.
*   How can bioinformatics tools help identify issues related to experimental design post-data collection?

**Morning Session 2: Quality Control Tools (e.g., FastQC, MultiQC, Trimmomatic)**

Once raw sequencing data is generated, the first critical step is Quality Control (QC). QC assesses the quality of the raw reads and identifies potential issues that could affect downstream analysis. Poor quality data can lead to inaccurate alignments, incorrect variant calls, and misleading expression quantification.

**FastQC:**

FastQC is a widely used tool for performing quality control checks on raw sequencing data (FASTQ files). It generates a comprehensive report with various modules that highlight potential problems in your data, such as:

*   **Per base sequence quality:** Shows the quality scores across each position in the reads.
*   **Per sequence quality scores:** Distribution of average quality scores over all reads.
*   **Per base sequence content:** Checks for biases in nucleotide composition at each position.
*   **Per sequence GC content:** Distribution of GC content across all reads.
*   **Sequence Length Distribution:** Shows the distribution of read lengths.
*   **Overrepresented sequences:** Identifies sequences that appear unusually frequently, often indicating contamination or adapter sequences.
*   **Adapter content:** Detects the presence of common sequencing adapter sequences.

**MultiQC:**

MultiQC is a powerful tool that aggregates results from multiple bioinformatics analysis tools (including FastQC, but also aligners, variant callers, etc.) into a single, interactive HTML report. This makes it incredibly easy to get a quick overview of the quality and success of your entire workflow across many samples. Instead of opening dozens of individual FastQC reports, MultiQC consolidates them into one summary.

**Trimmomatic:**

Trimmomatic is a flexible and high-performance tool for trimming and cropping Illumina (and other) sequencing reads. It is used to remove low-quality bases, adapter sequences, and short reads that can negatively impact alignment and downstream analysis. Common trimming operations include:

*   **ILLUMINACLIP:** Removes adapter sequences.
*   **LEADING/TRAILING:** Removes low-quality bases from the start/end of reads.
*   **SLIDINGWINDOW:** Performs a sliding window quality trim.
*   **MINLEN:** Removes reads shorter than a specified length.

**Workflow Example: QC and Trimming**

1.  **Run FastQC on raw FASTQ files:**
    ```bash
    fastqc raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz -o fastqc_reports
    ```
2.  **Run Trimmomatic to clean reads:**
    ```bash
    java -jar /path/to/trimmomatic.jar PE -phred33 \
        raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz \
        trimmed_R1_paired.fastq.gz trimmed_R1_unpaired.fastq.gz \
        trimmed_R2_paired.fastq.gz trimmed_R2_unpaired.fastq.gz \
        ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36
    ```
    *Note: Replace `/path/to/trimmomatic.jar` and `adapters.fa` with actual paths.*

3.  **Run FastQC again on trimmed reads to assess improvement:**
    ```bash
    fastqc trimmed_R1_paired.fastq.gz trimmed_R2_paired.fastq.gz -o fastqc_trimmed_reports
    ```
4.  **Run MultiQC to summarize all FastQC reports:**
    ```bash
    multiqc fastqc_reports fastqc_trimmed_reports -o multiqc_summary
    ```

**Afternoon Session: Linux & Apocrita [Queen Mary’s HPC] Hands-on Challenge**

This session will be a practical challenge where you will apply your accumulated Linux command-line skills and get a taste of working in an HPC environment. We will use a simulated or actual HPC environment (like Queen Mary University of London\'s Apocrita cluster, if access is provided and configured) to perform a basic bioinformatics task, emphasizing job submission and resource management.

**HPC Environment Overview (Apocrita Example):**

*   **Login:** Accessing the cluster via SSH.
*   **File Transfer:** Moving data to and from the cluster (e.g., using `scp` or `rsync`).
*   **Modules:** Loading necessary software (e.g., `module load FastQC`).
*   **Job Submission:** Writing and submitting a job script to the scheduler (e.g., Slurm).

**Example Slurm Job Script (`my_fastqc_job.sh`):**

```

**Challenge:**

Your challenge will be to take a provided raw sequencing dataset, perform quality control using FastQC and Trimmomatic, and then summarize the results using MultiQC, all within the HPC environment. This will test your ability to navigate the cluster, submit jobs, and manage your data effectively.

By the end of Week 1, you will have a strong foundation in the computational aspects of bioinformatics, including command-line proficiency, basic scripting, understanding of biological sequences and databases, and critical skills in data quality control and HPC usage. This knowledge will be essential as we move into more applied genomic analyses in Week 2.




## Week 2: Applied Bioinformatics for Genomics and Breeding

### Day 6: SNP Calling, Variant Processing, and Phylogenetics

Week 2 shifts our focus to applied bioinformatics, specifically in the context of genomics and breeding. Day 6 will introduce you to Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), their detection (SNP calling), processing variant data, and how to use genetic variation to understand evolutionary relationships through phylogenetics.

**Morning Session 1: Understanding SNPs and DArT markers (RAN to provide an introduction of Verdant Tag Panel)**

**Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs):**

SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation among individuals. A SNP occurs when a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) in the genome differs between members of a species or paired chromosomes in an individual. For example, at a specific position in the genome, one individual might have an \'A\' while another has a \'G\'.

*   **Significance:** SNPs are crucial genetic markers used in various applications:
    *   **Disease Association:** Identifying SNPs associated with disease susceptibility or resistance.
    *   **Pharmacogenomics:** Predicting an individual\'s response to drugs.
    *   **Population Genetics:** Studying genetic diversity and evolutionary history.
    *   **Plant and Animal Breeding:** Marker-assisted selection for desirable traits.
*   **Frequency:** To be considered a SNP, the variation must be present in at least 1% of the population.

**DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology) markers:**

DArT is a high-throughput genotyping platform used to discover and score thousands of genetic markers (often SNPs and presence/absence variations) across a genome. It is particularly useful for species with complex genomes or without a reference genome. DArT markers are often used in breeding programs for genetic mapping, diversity analysis, and marker-assisted selection.

*   **Verdant Tag Panel (RAN to provide introduction):** This refers to a specific DArT marker panel, likely optimized for certain plant species or breeding objectives. The trainer (RAN) will provide specific details on its application and utility.

**Morning Session 2: SNP Calling and Annotation (e.g., GATK, Stacks, bcftools, VCFtools, SnpEff)**

SNP calling is the process of identifying genetic variations (SNPs and small insertions/deletions, or indels) from sequencing data. This typically involves aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome and then identifying positions where the observed nucleotides differ from the reference.

**General SNP Calling Workflow:**

1.  **Read Alignment:** Align raw sequencing reads (FASTQ) to a reference genome (e.g., using BWA, Bowtie2) to produce BAM files.
2.  **Variant Discovery:** Identify potential variant sites based on discrepancies between reads and the reference.
3.  **Variant Genotyping:** Determine the genotype (e.g., homozygous reference, heterozygous, homozygous alternative) at each variant site for each sample.
4.  **Variant Filtering:** Apply filters to remove low-quality or artifactual variants.

**Common Tools for SNP Calling:**

    *   **GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit):** A widely used, industry-standard suite of tools for variant discovery and genotyping, particularly for human genome data. It includes best practices workflows for germline and somatic variant calling.
        *   Key steps in GATK best practices: Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR), Indel Realignment, HaplotypeCaller (for variant discovery), GenotypeGVCFs (for joint genotyping).
        ```bash
        # Example GATK workflow (conceptual, requires Java and GATK installed)
        # 1. Index reference genome (if not already done)
        # samtools faidx reference.fasta
        # java -jar picard.jar CreateSequenceDictionary R=reference.fasta O=reference.dict

        # 2. HaplotypeCaller (for variant discovery, per sample)
        # gatk HaplotypeCaller -R reference.fasta -I aligned_reads.bam -O raw_variants.g.vcf.gz -ERC GVCF

        # 3. CombineGVCFs (if multiple samples)
        # gatk CombineGVCFs -R reference.fasta -V sample1.g.vcf.gz -V sample2.g.vcf.gz -O combined.g.vcf.gz

        # 4. GenotypeGVCFs (joint genotyping)
        # gatk GenotypeGVCFs -R reference.fasta -V combined.g.vcf.gz -O raw_variants.vcf.gz

        # 5. Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) - for large datasets
        # gatk VariantRecalibrator -R reference.fasta -V raw_variants.vcf.gz ... -O recal.tranches
        # gatk ApplyVQSR -R reference.fasta -V raw_variants.vcf.gz ... -O final_variants.vcf.gz
        ```
    *   **Stacks:** A software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences, particularly useful for SNP discovery and genotyping in populations without a reference genome (de novo assembly) or with a reference (reference-based assembly).
        ```bash
        # Example Stacks workflow (conceptual)
        # 1. Process_radtags (demultiplexing and quality filtering)
        # process_radtags -f raw_reads.fastq -o ./output_dir -b barcodes.txt -e sbfI -r -c -q -t 90 --inline_null

        # 2. Ustacks (de novo assembly of loci within individuals)
        # ustacks -f sample_1.fq -o ./output_dir -i 1 -m 3 -M 2 -p 4

        # 3. Cstacks (build catalog of loci across individuals)
        # cstacks -b 1 -P ./output_dir -s sample1 -s sample2 -s sampleN

        # 4. Sstacks (match samples to catalog)
        # sstacks -b 1 -P ./output_dir -s sample1 -s sample2 -s sampleN

        # 5. Gstacks (genotype individuals from aligned reads)
        # gstacks -b 1 -P ./output_dir -t 4

        # 6. Populations (filter and export VCF)
        # populations -P ./output_dir -M popmap.txt -r 0.8 --vcf
        ```
    *   **bcftools:** A suite of command-line utilities for manipulating and analyzing VCF (Variant Call Format) files. It can be used for filtering, merging, and comparing VCF files, as well as for basic variant calling.
        ```bash
        # Example bcftools variant calling workflow
        # 1. Align reads (e.g., with BWA) and sort/index BAM (as shown in Hands-on section)

        # 2. Call variants using mpileup and call
        bcftools mpileup -Ou -f reference.fasta aligned_reads.sorted.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ov -o variants.vcf

        # 3. Filter variants (example: remove low quality variants)
        bcftools view -i \'QUAL>20 && FORMAT/DP>10\' variants.vcf -o filtered_variants.vcf
        ```
    *   **VCFtools:** Another set of command-line tools for working with VCF files, offering functionalities for filtering, statistics, and format conversion.
        ```bash
        # Example VCFtools usage (filtering and statistics)
        # Filter variants by minor allele frequency (MAF) and missing data
        vcftools --vcf variants.vcf --maf 0.05 --max-missing 0.8 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out filtered_by_maf_missing

        # Calculate SNP diversity (pi)
        vcftools --vcf filtered_variants.vcf --site-pi --out site_pi
        ```

**SNP Annotation:**

Once SNPs are called, they need to be annotated to understand their potential functional impact. Annotation involves determining if a SNP is in a gene, what type of change it causes (e.g., synonymous, non-synonymous, stop-gain), and if it has been previously reported in databases.

*   **SnpEff:** A popular tool for annotating genetic variants. It predicts the effect of variants on genes and proteins (e.g., missense, nonsense, frameshift) and can integrate with various databases.
    ```bash
    # Example SnpEff workflow
    # 1. Download and build the SnpEff database for your organism (e.g., for human GRCh38)
    # java -jar snpEff.jar download GRCh38

    # For custom genome/annotation (requires GTF/GFF3 and FASTA)
    # Create a snpEff.config file pointing to your genome and annotation
    # java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v your_organism_database

    # 2. Annotate your VCF file
    java -jar snpEff.jar your_organism_database filtered_variants.vcf > annotated_variants.vcf
    ```

**Afternoon Session 3: Hands-on Practice: SNP Calling Workflow**

In this hands-on session, we will perform a simplified SNP calling workflow using a small dataset. We will focus on practical application of some of the tools discussed.

**Example Workflow Steps (using a subset of tools):**

1.  **Reference Genome Preparation:** Indexing the reference genome for alignment.
    ```bash
    bwa index reference.fasta
    samtools faidx reference.fasta
    java -jar picard.jar CreateSequenceDictionary R=reference.fasta O=reference.dict
    ```
2.  **Read Alignment (e.g., BWA-MEM):**
    ```bash
    bwa mem reference.fasta raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz | samtools view -bS - > aligned_reads.bam
    ```
3.  **Sort and Index BAM:**
    ```bash
    samtools sort aligned_reads.bam -o aligned_reads.sorted.bam
    samtools index aligned_reads.sorted.bam
    ```
4.  **Variant Calling (e.g., bcftools):**
    ```bash
    bcftools mpileup -Ou -f reference.fasta aligned_reads.sorted.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ov -o variants.vcf
    ```
5.  **Variant Filtering (e.g., VCFtools):**
    ```bash
    vcftools --vcf variants.vcf --remove-filtered-all --min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out filtered_variants
    ```
6.  **Variant Annotation (e.g., SnpEff):**
    ```bash
    # First, download and build the SnpEff database for your organism
    # java -jar snpEff.jar download GRCh38 # Example for human
    java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v your_organism_database # For custom database
    java -jar snpEff.jar your_organism_database filtered_variants.recode.vcf > annotated_variants.vcf
    ```

**Afternoon Session 4: Hands-on: Constructing Phylogenetic Trees**

Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms (or genes) through time. Phylogenetic trees are diagrams that depict these relationships. They are constructed based on genetic (or morphological) data, often using sequence variations like SNPs.

**Key Concepts in Phylogenetics:**

*   **Taxa/OTUs:** The operational taxonomic units (e.g., species, individuals, genes) at the tips of the branches.
*   **Nodes:** Represent common ancestors.
*   **Branches:** Represent evolutionary lineages.
*   **Root:** The common ancestor of all taxa in the tree (if rooted).
*   **Clade:** A group of organisms that includes an ancestor and all of its descendants.

**Methods for Tree Construction:**

*   **Distance-based methods (e.g., Neighbor-Joining):** Calculate genetic distances between sequences and then build a tree based on these distances.
*   **Parsimony methods:** Find the tree that requires the fewest evolutionary changes (mutations) to explain the observed data.
*   **Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods:** Find the tree that maximizes the probability of observing the given data under a specific evolutionary model.
*   **Bayesian methods:** Use Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior probability of trees.

**Hands-on Practice with Phylogenetic Tools:**

We will use a set of aligned sequences (e.g., from a multi-sample VCF converted to FASTA) and apply tools to construct and visualize phylogenetic trees.

**Tools (examples):**

    *   **MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis):** A user-friendly software for sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and evolutionary analysis. (Often GUI-based, but command-line versions or specific modules can be used).
    *   **RAxML/IQ-TREE:** Popular command-line tools for maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference, known for their speed and accuracy.
        ```bash
        # Example RAxML-NG workflow (conceptual)
        # 1. Prepare input alignment (e.g., FASTA format)
        # 2. Run RAxML-NG for tree inference and bootstrapping
        raxml-ng --msa input_alignment.fasta --model GTR+G --prefix T1 --threads 4 --bs-trees 100
        # --msa: input multiple sequence alignment
        # --model: evolutionary model (e.g., GTR+G for nucleotides)
        # --prefix: output file prefix
        # --threads: number of CPU threads
        # --bs-trees: number of bootstrap replicates
        ```
    *   **FastTree:** A fast algorithm for constructing approximate maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from large alignments.
        ```bash
        # Example with FastTree (assuming input.fasta is your aligned sequence file)
        FastTree -gtr -nt input.fasta > tree.nwk
        # -gtr: General Time Reversible model (for nucleotide data)
        # -nt: Specifies nucleotide data
        # tree.nwk: Output tree in Newick format
        ```
    *   **FigTree/iTOL:** Tools for visualizing and annotating phylogenetic trees.

**Example Workflow (Conceptual):**

1.  **Prepare Input Data:** Convert your VCF file (containing SNPs from multiple samples) into a format suitable for phylogenetic analysis (e.g., FASTA alignment). This often involves custom scripting or tools like `vcf2phylip`.
    ```bash
    # Conceptual step: Convert VCF to FASTA alignment for phylogenetic analysis
    # This often requires a custom script or tool like vcf2phylip.py
    # python vcf2phylip.py -i your_variants.vcf -o alignment.phy
    # Or for simple FASTA from VCF (for SNP sites only):
    # bcftools query -f ">[%SAMPLE\t%REF%ALT]\n" your_variants.vcf | sed \'s/\t//g\' > alignment.fasta
    ```
2.  **Run Tree Construction:** Execute a phylogenetic program.
    ```bash
    # Using FastTree for a quick tree
    FastTree -gtr -nt alignment.fasta > tree.nwk
    ```
3.  **Visualize Tree:** Open the `.nwk` file in a tree visualization software like FigTree or upload to iTOL.

By the end of Day 6, you will have a practical understanding of how to identify genetic variations and use them to infer evolutionary relationships, skills critical for both basic research and applied breeding programs.
