## Week 1: Foundations of Bioinformatics and Genomic Data Handling

## Day 3: Biological Databases, Genomic Data Formats, and Data Retrieval

Day 3 will focus on the vast world of **biological databases**, the **fundamental concepts of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences**, and practical methods for retrieving and handling these data.  
Accessing and managing biological data efficiently is a cornerstone of bioinformatics, since these sequences are the raw material for most analyses.  

We will also learn how to compare biological sequences and explore how to visualize similarities and differences using **dot plot analysis**, with a hands-on session in **R**.  


**Morning Session: Basics of DNA, RNA, and Protein Sequences**

This session will provide a foundational understanding of the different types of biological sequences and their significance in molecular biology and genomics.

**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): The Blueprint of Life**

*   **Structure:** DNA is a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).
*   **Base Pairing:** A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G (Chargaff\'s rules). This complementary base pairing is crucial for DNA replication and repair.
*   **Function:** DNA carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. It serves as the long-term storage of genetic information.
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** DNA sequences are typically represented as strings of A, T, C, G characters.

**RNA (Ribonucleic Acid): The Messenger and More**

*   **Structure:** RNA is typically single-stranded and contains ribose sugar instead of deoxyribose. It has Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T), so A pairs with U, and C pairs with G.
*   **Types and Functions:**
    *   **mRNA (messenger RNA):** Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis.
    *   **tRNA (transfer RNA):** Carries specific amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.
    *   **rRNA (ribosomal RNA):** A structural component of ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs.
    *   **Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs):** A diverse group of RNAs with regulatory and catalytic functions (e.g., microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs).
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** RNA sequences are represented as strings of A, U, C, G characters.

**Proteins: The Workhorses of the Cell**

*   **Structure:** Proteins are complex macromolecules made up of chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. There are 20 common amino acids, each with a unique side chain.
*   **Levels of Structure:** Proteins fold into specific three-dimensional structures (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) that determine their function.
*   **Function:** Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions (enzymes), DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules.
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** Protein sequences are represented as strings of single-letter amino acid codes (e.g., A for Alanine, L for Leucine).

**The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology:**

DNA -> RNA -> Protein. This fundamental concept describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. Bioinformatics plays a critical role in analyzing and understanding each step of this process.

**Biological Databases:**

Biological databases are organized collections of biological data, often made publicly available to researchers worldwide. They are essential for storing, organizing, and retrieving the ever-increasing volume of biological information generated by high-throughput technologies.

**Types of Biological Databases:**

*   **Primary Databases:** Store raw experimental data (e.g., DNA sequences, protein structures). Examples include GenBank (DNA sequences), UniProt (protein sequences and functional information), PDB (Protein Data Bank - 3D protein structures).
*   **Secondary Databases:** Contain analyzed, annotated, and curated data derived from primary databases. Examples include RefSeq (curated non-redundant sequences), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes - pathways and diseases), Pfam (protein families).
*   **Specialized Databases:** Focus on specific types of data or organisms (e.g., dbSNP for single nucleotide polymorphisms, Ensembl for vertebrate genomes, TAIR for *Arabidopsis thaliana*).

**Omics data and databases for crop plants**

## Common Genomic Data Formats

When downloading data from databases, you’ll encounter a few **standard formats**. Each has its own structure and purpose. Understanding these is key to working with bioinformatics tools.

### FASTA Format
The most common way to store **DNA, RNA, or protein sequences**.  
- The first line starts with `>` and is the **header** (sequence ID + description).  
- The following lines are the **sequence**.  

```text
# FASTA example
>gene1 description of gene1
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
>gene2 hypothetical protein
TTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG
```

### FASTQ Format  
Stores raw reads from sequencing machines. Each entry has 4 lines:  
- `@` → sequence identifier  
- The nucleotide sequence  
- `+` → separator (optionally repeats identifier)  
- Quality scores (ASCII-encoded, one per base)  

```text
# FASTQ example
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTTAAAGGG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**
```

### GFF (General Feature Format)  
Stores genome annotations, like gene positions, exons, and regulatory features. Each row corresponds to a feature along the genome.  

Columns typically include:  
- Chromosome  
- Source  
- Feature type (gene, exon, CDS…)  
- Start and end positions  
- Strand (+/-)  
- Additional info (IDs, parent features, etc.)  

```text
# GFF example
chr1    TAIR10  gene    3631    5899    .    +    .    ID=AT1G01010
chr1    TAIR10  exon    3631    3913    .    +    .    Parent=AT1G01010
```

### VCF (Variant Call Format)  
Stores genetic variants such as SNPs, insertions, or deletions.  

The file has a header (lines starting with #) followed by variant entries with columns such as:  
- Chromosome (`CHROM`)  
- Position (`POS`)  
- Reference allele (`REF`)  
- Alternative allele (`ALT`)  
- Quality scores and filters  

```text
# VCF example
#CHROM   POS     ID      REF     ALT     QUAL    FILTER  INFO
chr1     10583   rs1     G       A       29      PASS    .
chr1     10611   rs2     C       T       67      PASS    .
```

## Exercise – Exploring Biological Databases and Using BLAST

Today we will learn how to **search, retrieve, and explore sequences** using major biological databases.  
We will practice with *Elaeis guineensis* (oil palm), an important crop for breeding and oil production.  

By the end of the session you should be able to:  
- Search for genes and proteins in **NCBI** and **UniProt**.  
- Retrieve sequences in **FASTA format**.  
- Use **BLAST** to find homologous sequences in other species.  
- Interpret BLAST results in the context of breeding and comparative genomics.  


### Part 1 – Searching in NCBI Gene and Nucleotide 

**Task 1: Find a gene of interest**
1. Go to [NCBI Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/).  
2. Search for **"Elaeis guineensis FAD2"** (fatty acid desaturase 2, involved in oil composition).  
3. Explore the result page:  
   - What is the **Gene ID**?  
   - On which **chromosome** is it located?  
   - Which types of sequences are linked (genomic DNA, mRNA, protein)?  


**Task 2: Retrieve the nucleotide sequence**
1. From the Gene page, click the **NCBI Nucleotide** link.  
2. Download the **mRNA sequence** in FASTA format.  
3. Save it locally as `EgFAD2.fasta`.  

**❓ Question:** What does the header line (the line starting with `>`) tell you about the sequence?  


**Task 3: Retrieve another gene**
1. Search for **"Elaeis guineensis STAD"** (Stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein, also involved in oil biosynthesis).  
2. Repeat the steps above to download the FASTA sequence.  
3. Save it as `EgSTAD.fasta`.  

**Reflection:** Why might FAD2 and STAD be important candidate genes in oil palm breeding?  



### Part 2 – Exploring Proteins in UniProt 

**Task 4: Search for the protein**
1. Go to [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/).  
2. Search for **"Elaeis guineensis STAD"**.  
3. Click on the reviewed entry (if available) or the best hit.  

**❓ Questions:**  
- What is the **UniProt accession number**?  
- What information does UniProt provide that is not present in NCBI?  


**Task 5: Download the protein sequence**
1. Download the protein sequence in FASTA format.  
2. Save it as `EgSTAD_protein.fasta`.  

**Challenge:** Compare the nucleotide sequence from NCBI with the amino acid sequence from UniProt. How are they related?  



### Part 3 – BLAST Analysis 

We will now use BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to explore sequence similarity.

**Task 6: BLASTn with FAD2 nucleotide**
1. Open [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).  
2. Select **nucleotide BLAST (blastn)**.  
3. Paste the sequence from `EgFAD2.fasta`.  
4. Database: **nt (nucleotide collection)**  
5. Organism filter: **Viridiplantae (green plants)**  
6. Run the search.  

**❓ Questions:**  
- What is the top hit?  
- Which species show the highest similarity to oil palm FAD2?  
- What is the **percent identity** and **E-value** of the alignment?  


**Task 7: BLASTp with FAD2 protein**
1. Select **protein BLAST (blastp)**.  
2. Paste the sequence from `EgFAD2_protein.fasta`.  
3. Database: **nr (non-redundant protein sequences)**.  
4. Run the search.  

**❓ Questions:**  
- Which oilseed crops (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed) appear in the results?  
- Why is protein BLAST often more informative than nucleotide BLAST for distant species?  


### Bonus Practical — UniProt Curation Check (Swiss-Prot vs TrEMBL) for Palm Species

In this exercise you will check **how many proteins are reviewed (Swiss-Prot) and unreviewed (TrEMBL)** in UniProt for oil palm and related palm species. This helps understand how well protein data is curated for breeding applications.


Go to [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) and enter these queries in the search bar:
- *Elaeis guineensis* 

Repeat to:
- *Elaeis oleifera* (American oil palm)  
- *Phoenix dactylifera* (Date palm)
- *Cocos nucifera* (Coconut)   

**Reflection**
- Which palm species has the highest number of **reviewed proteins**?  
- What does this suggest about the **confidence in protein function annotations** for oil palm compared to its relatives?


### Part 4 – Exploring the Oil Palm Genome 

**Task 2: Browse the genome**  
1. Go to [NCBI – Genome database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/).
2. Search for *Elaeis guineensis* 
3. Explore the genome assembly page:  
   - What is the assembly name and version?  
   - How many chromosomes/scaffolds are present?  
   - What is the total genome size?  
3. Use the **Genome Browser** to locate the **EgFAD2 gene** on its chromosome.  

**Reflection:** Why is having a complete reference genome important for SNP discovery and marker development?  


### Part 5 – Exploring the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)

The **NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive)** stores raw sequencing reads from published experiments.  

**Task 3: Search for oil palm datasets**  
1. Go to [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).  
2. Search for: 
- *Elaeis guineensis* 

3. Identify one dataset that looks interesting for breeding (e.g., RNA-seq from developing mesocarp or any type of stress).

**Reflection**
- What different **data types** did you see linked to oil palm in SRA (e.g., whole-genome resequencing, transcriptomics, long-read assemblies)?  
- Which of these data types might be **most useful for breeders**?  
- Why is it important to know whether data is **raw (SRA)** or **curated (annotations, proteins, variants)**?
