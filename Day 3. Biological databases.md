## Week 1: Foundations of Bioinformatics and Genomic Data Handling

## Day 3: Biological Databases, Genomic Data Formats, and Data Retrieval

Day 3 will focus on the vast world of biological databases, understanding common genomic data formats, and practical methods for retrieving data. Accessing and managing biological data efficiently is a cornerstone of bioinformatics.

**Biological Databases:**

Biological databases are organized collections of biological data, often made publicly available to researchers worldwide. They are essential for storing, organizing, and retrieving the ever-increasing volume of biological information generated by high-throughput technologies.

**Types of Biological Databases:**

*   **Primary Databases:** Store raw experimental data (e.g., DNA sequences, protein structures). Examples include GenBank (DNA sequences), UniProt (protein sequences and functional information), PDB (Protein Data Bank - 3D protein structures).
*   **Secondary Databases:** Contain analyzed, annotated, and curated data derived from primary databases. Examples include RefSeq (curated non-redundant sequences), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes - pathways and diseases), Pfam (protein families).
*   **Specialized Databases:** Focus on specific types of data or organisms (e.g., dbSNP for single nucleotide polymorphisms, Ensembl for vertebrate genomes, TAIR for *Arabidopsis thaliana*).

## Common Genomic Data Formats

When downloading data from databases, you’ll encounter a few **standard formats**. Each has its own structure and purpose. Understanding these is key to working with bioinformatics tools.

### FASTA Format
The most common way to store **DNA, RNA, or protein sequences**.  
- The first line starts with `>` and is the **header** (sequence ID + description).  
- The following lines are the **sequence**.  

```text
# FASTA example
>gene1 description of gene1
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
>gene2 hypothetical protein
TTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG
```

### FASTQ Format  
Stores raw reads from sequencing machines. Each entry has 4 lines:  
- `@` → sequence identifier  
- The nucleotide sequence  
- `+` → separator (optionally repeats identifier)  
- Quality scores (ASCII-encoded, one per base)  

```text
# FASTQ example
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTTAAAGGG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**
```

### GFF (General Feature Format)  
Stores genome annotations, like gene positions, exons, and regulatory features. Each row corresponds to a feature along the genome.  

Columns typically include:  
- Chromosome  
- Source  
- Feature type (gene, exon, CDS…)  
- Start and end positions  
- Strand (+/-)  
- Additional info (IDs, parent features, etc.)  

```text
# GFF example
chr1    TAIR10  gene    3631    5899    .    +    .    ID=AT1G01010
chr1    TAIR10  exon    3631    3913    .    +    .    Parent=AT1G01010
```

### VCF (Variant Call Format)  
Stores genetic variants such as SNPs, insertions, or deletions.  

The file has a header (lines starting with #) followed by variant entries with columns such as:  
- Chromosome (`CHROM`)  
- Position (`POS`)  
- Reference allele (`REF`)  
- Alternative allele (`ALT`)  
- Quality scores and filters  

```text
# VCF example
#CHROM   POS     ID      REF     ALT     QUAL    FILTER  INFO
chr1     10583   rs1     G       A       29      PASS    .
chr1     10611   rs2     C       T       67      PASS    .
```

## Exercise – Exploring Biological Databases and Using BLAST

Today we will learn how to **search, retrieve, and explore sequences** using major biological databases.  
We will practice with *Elaeis guineensis* (oil palm), an important crop for breeding and oil production.  

By the end of the session you should be able to:  
- Search for genes and proteins in **NCBI** and **UniProt**.  
- Retrieve sequences in **FASTA format**.  
- Use **BLAST** to find homologous sequences in other species.  
- Interpret BLAST results in the context of breeding and comparative genomics.  


### Part 1 – Searching in NCBI Gene and Nucleotide 

**Task 1: Find a gene of interest**
1. Go to [NCBI Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/).  
2. Search for **"Elaeis guineensis FAD2"** (fatty acid desaturase 2, involved in oil composition).  
3. Explore the result page:  
   - What is the **Gene ID**?  
   - On which **chromosome** is it located?  
   - Which types of sequences are linked (genomic DNA, mRNA, protein)?  


**Task 2: Retrieve the nucleotide sequence**
1. From the Gene page, click the **NCBI Nucleotide** link.  
2. Download the **mRNA sequence** in FASTA format.  
3. Save it locally as `EgFAD2.fasta`.  

**Question:** What does the header line (the line starting with `>`) tell you about the sequence?  


**Task 3: Retrieve another gene**
1. Search for **"Elaeis guineensis DGAT1"** (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, also involved in oil biosynthesis).  
2. Repeat the steps above to download the FASTA sequence.  
3. Save it as `EgDGAT1.fasta`.  

**Reflection:** Why might FAD2 and DGAT1 be important candidate genes in oil palm breeding?  



### Part 2 – Exploring Proteins in UniProt 

**Task 4: Search for the protein**
1. Go to [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/).  
2. Search for **"Elaeis guineensis FAD2"**.  
3. Click on the reviewed entry (if available) or the best hit.  

**Questions:**  
- What is the **UniProt accession number**?  
- What information does UniProt provide that is not present in NCBI?  


**Task 5: Download the protein sequence**
1. Download the protein sequence in FASTA format.  
2. Save it as `EgFAD2_protein.fasta`.  

**Challenge:** Compare the nucleotide sequence from NCBI with the amino acid sequence from UniProt. How are they related?  



### Part 3 – BLAST Analysis 

We will now use BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to explore sequence similarity.

**Task 6: BLASTn with FAD2 nucleotide**
1. Open [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).  
2. Select **nucleotide BLAST (blastn)**.  
3. Paste the sequence from `EgFAD2.fasta`.  
4. Database: **nt (nucleotide collection)**  
5. Organism filter: **Viridiplantae (green plants)**  
6. Run the search.  

**Questions:**  
- What is the top hit?  
- Which species show the highest similarity to oil palm FAD2?  
- What is the **percent identity** and **E-value** of the alignment?  


**Task 7: BLASTp with FAD2 protein**
1. Select **protein BLAST (blastp)**.  
2. Paste the sequence from `EgFAD2_protein.fasta`.  
3. Database: **nr (non-redundant protein sequences)**.  
4. Run the search.  

**Questions:**  
- Which oilseed crops (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed) appear in the results?  
- Why is protein BLAST often more informative than nucleotide BLAST for distant species?  


### Bonus Practical — UniProt Curation Check (Swiss-Prot vs TrEMBL) for Palm Species

In this exercise you will check **how many proteins are reviewed (Swiss-Prot) and unreviewed (TrEMBL)** in UniProt for oil palm and related palm species. This helps understand how well protein data is curated for breeding applications.


Go to [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) and enter these queries in the search bar:
- *Elaeis guineensis* 

Repeat to:
- *Elaeis oleifera* (American oil palm)  
- *Phoenix dactylifera* (Date palm)
- *Cocos nucifera* (Coconut)   

**Reflection**
- Which palm species has the highest number of **reviewed proteins**?  
- What does this suggest about the **confidence in protein function annotations** for oil palm compared to its relatives?


### Part 4 – Exploring the Oil Palm Genome 

**Task 2: Browse the genome**  
1. Go to [NCBI – Genome database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/).
2. Search for *Elaeis guineensis* 
3. Explore the genome assembly page:  
   - What is the assembly name and version?  
   - How many chromosomes/scaffolds are present?  
   - What is the total genome size?  
3. Use the **Genome Browser** to locate the **EgFAD2 gene** on its chromosome.  

**Reflection:** Why is having a complete reference genome important for SNP discovery and marker development?  


### Part 5 – Exploring the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)

The **NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive)** stores raw sequencing reads from published experiments.  

**Task 3: Search for oil palm datasets**  
1. Go to [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).  
2. Search for: 
- *Elaeis guineensis* 

3. Identify one dataset that looks interesting for breeding (e.g., RNA-seq from developing mesocarp or any type of stress).

**Reflection**
- What different **data types** did you see linked to oil palm in SRA (e.g., whole-genome resequencing, transcriptomics, long-read assemblies)?  
- Which of these data types might be **most useful for breeders**?  
- Why is it important to know whether data is **raw (SRA)** or **curated (annotations, proteins, variants)**?
