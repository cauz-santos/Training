## Week 1: Foundations of Bioinformatics and Genomic Data Handling

### Day 1: Linux, Command Line, and HPC Usage

**Morning Session: Introduction to Linux OS & Command Line Basics**

This session will introduce you to the Linux operating system, which is the backbone of most bioinformatics workflows. We will cover the fundamental concepts of Linux, its file system, and how to interact with it using the command line interface (CLI). A strong understanding of the command line is crucial for efficient data manipulation and running bioinformatics tools.

**What is Linux?**

Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system widely used in scientific computing, including bioinformatics. Its stability, flexibility, and robust command-line tools make it an ideal environment for handling large biological datasets and running computationally intensive analyses.

**Why the Command Line?**

The command line allows you to interact with your computer by typing commands instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI). While it might seem daunting at first, the CLI offers unparalleled control, efficiency, and automation capabilities, which are essential for bioinformatics tasks. Many bioinformatics tools are exclusively command-line based.

**Basic Command Line Operations:**

We will start with the most essential commands that you will use daily:

*   `pwd`: Print Working Directory - Shows your current location in the file system.
*   `ls`: List - Lists the contents of a directory.
    *   `ls -l`: Long format, showing permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
    *   `ls -a`: All, including hidden files.
*   `cd`: Change Directory - Navigates between directories.
    *   `cd ..`: Move up one directory.
    *   `cd ~`: Go to your home directory.
    *   `cd /path/to/directory`: Go to a specific absolute path.
*   `mkdir`: Make Directory - Creates a new directory.
*   `rmdir`: Remove Directory - Deletes an empty directory.
*   `touch`: Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
*   `cp`: Copy - Copies files or directories.
    *   `cp file1 file2`: Copies `file1` to `file2`.
    *   `cp -r dir1 dir2`: Recursively copies `dir1` to `dir2`.
*   `mv`: Move/Rename - Moves or renames files or directories.
*   `rm`: Remove - Deletes files or directories.
    *   `rm file`: Deletes a file.
    *   `rm -r dir`: Recursively deletes a directory and its contents.
    *   `rm -f file`: Force delete (no prompt).
    *   `rm -rf dir`: Force recursive delete (use with extreme caution!).
*   `cat`: Concatenate and display files - Displays the content of a file.
*   `less`: Pager - Views file content one screen at a time (useful for large files).
*   `head`: Displays the first few lines of a file.
*   `tail`: Displays the last few lines of a file.
*   `grep`: Global Regular Expression Print - Searches for patterns in text files.
    *   `grep 


### Day 1: Linux, Command Line, and HPC Usage (Continued)

**Afternoon Session: Practice Session on Linux**

This hands-on session will allow you to apply the basic Linux commands learned in the morning. We will work through a series of exercises designed to solidify your understanding of file system navigation, file manipulation, and basic text processing. The goal is to build your confidence and proficiency in using the command line, which is fundamental for all subsequent bioinformatics tasks.

**Practice Exercises:**

1.  **Navigating the File System:**
    *   Create a new directory named `bioinformatics_training` in your home directory.
    *   Navigate into this new directory.
    *   Inside `bioinformatics_training`, create two subdirectories: `data` and `scripts`.
    *   Navigate into the `data` directory.
    *   Return to the `bioinformatics_training` directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/bioinformatics_training
    cd ~/bioinformatics_training
    mkdir data scripts
    cd data
    cd ..
    pwd
    ```

2.  **Creating and Manipulating Files:**
    *   Inside the `data` directory, create an empty file named `sample_data.txt`.
    *   Add some text to `sample_data.txt` using the `echo` command and redirection (e.g., `echo "This is a test line." > sample_data.txt`).
    *   View the content of `sample_data.txt` using `cat` and `less`.
    *   Copy `sample_data.txt` to `data_backup.txt` within the same directory.
    *   Move `data_backup.txt` from the `data` directory to the `scripts` directory.
    *   Rename `data_backup.txt` in the `scripts` directory to `first_script_notes.txt`.

    ```bash
    cd data
    touch sample_data.txt
    echo "This is the first line of sample data." > sample_data.txt
    echo "This is the second line." >> sample_data.txt
    cat sample_data.txt
    less sample_data.txt
    cp sample_data.txt data_backup.txt
    mv data_backup.txt ../scripts/
    cd ../scripts/
    mv data_backup.txt first_script_notes.txt
    ls -l
    ```

3.  **Searching and Filtering Text:**
    *   Create a file named `genomic_sequences.txt` in the `data` directory with some example sequences (e.g., lines starting with `>gene1`, `>gene2`, `ATGCATGC`, `CGTACGTA`).
    *   Use `grep` to find all lines that start with `>`.
    *   Use `grep` to find all lines containing `ATGC`.
    *   Combine `head` and `tail` with pipes (`|`) to view specific parts of a file.

    ```bash
    cd ../data
    echo ">gene1\nATGCATGCATGC\n>gene2\nCGTACGTACGTAG\nATGCATGC" > genomic_sequences.txt
    grep ">" genomic_sequences.txt
    grep "ATGC" genomic_sequences.txt
    head -n 1 genomic_sequences.txt | tail -n 1
    ```

4.  **Introduction to HPC Usage (Conceptual):**

    While direct hands-on HPC (High-Performance Computing) usage will be covered in more detail later (e.g., Day 5 with Apocrita), it's important to understand the concept from Day 1. HPC clusters are powerful computing resources used for large-scale bioinformatics analyses that require significant computational power and memory. They typically involve:

    *   **Login Nodes:** Where you log in and prepare your jobs.
    *   **Compute Nodes:** Where your actual analyses run.
    *   **Job Schedulers (e.g., Slurm, PBS):** Systems that manage and allocate resources for your jobs.
    *   **Shared File Systems:** Where data is stored and accessed by all nodes.

    For this course, we will simulate some HPC interactions using the command line, and later, if applicable, we will connect to a real HPC environment like Apocrita. The commands you learn today are directly transferable to an HPC environment.

    **Key HPC Concepts:**
    *   **Batch Jobs:** Submitting scripts to run on compute nodes without direct interaction.
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Requesting specific CPU cores, memory, and time for your jobs.
    *   **Modules:** Software management system to load different versions of bioinformatics tools.

    We will delve deeper into these concepts and practical applications in later sessions, especially when we discuss data quality control and large-scale analyses. For now, focus on mastering the basic Linux commands, as they are the foundation for interacting with any computing environment, including HPCs.




### Day 2: Bioinformatics Scripting Essentials (Bash, Python)

**Session: Writing Bioinformatics Scripts (Parsing FASTA Files, Automation)**

On Day 2, we transition from using individual commands to combining them into scripts. Scripting is the key to automating repetitive tasks, creating reproducible workflows, and handling large datasets efficiently. We will cover the fundamentals of scripting in two powerful languages for bioinformatics: Bash and Python.

**Introduction to Bash Scripting**

Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is the default command-line interpreter on most Linux systems. A Bash script is simply a text file containing a series of commands that are executed sequentially. It's an excellent tool for automating command-line workflows.

**Creating a Simple Bash Script:**

1.  **Create a script file:** Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` to create a file, for example, `my_first_script.sh`.
2.  **Add the shebang:** The first line of a Bash script should be `#!/bin/bash`. This tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to run the script.
3.  **Add commands:** Add the commands you want to execute, one per line.
4.  **Make the script executable:** Use the `chmod +x my_first_script.sh` command to give the script execute permissions.
5.  **Run the script:** Execute the script by typing `./my_first_script.sh`.

**Example Bash Script for Automation:**

Let's create a script that automates the process of creating a new project directory with subdirectories for data, scripts, and results.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script creates a new project directory structure

PROJECT_NAME=$1 # Get the project name from the command line

mkdir $PROJECT_NAME
cd $PROJECT_NAME
mkdir data scripts results

echo "Project directory '$PROJECT_NAME' created successfully."
```

To run this script, you would save it as `create_project.sh`, make it executable (`chmod +x create_project.sh`), and then run it with a project name as an argument: `./create_project.sh my_new_project`.

**Introduction to Python for Bioinformatics**

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language that has become a cornerstone of bioinformatics due to its readability, extensive libraries (like Biopython), and powerful data analysis capabilities. We will cover the absolute basics to get you started.

**Python Fundamentals:**

*   **Data Types:** We will introduce fundamental data types such as strings (for sequences), integers, floats, lists (for storing collections of items), and dictionaries (for key-value pairs).
*   **Loops:** Loops are essential for iterating over data. We will cover `for` loops, which are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or a string).
*   **File Handling:** A crucial skill in bioinformatics is reading from and writing to files. We will learn how to open files, read their content line by line, and write results to new files.

**Parsing FASTA Files with Python:**

FASTA is a common text-based format for representing nucleotide or peptide sequences. A FASTA file can contain one or more sequences, each with a header line starting with `>` followed by the sequence data on subsequent lines.

Here is a simple Python script to parse a FASTA file and print the header and sequence for each entry:

```python
# fasta_parser.py

def parse_fasta(filename):
    """Parses a FASTA file and yields header, sequence pairs."""
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        header = ''
        sequence = ''
        for line in f:
            line = line.strip() # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
            if line.startswith('>'):
                if header: # If we have a previous sequence, yield it
                    yield header, sequence
                header = line[1:] # Remove the '>'
                sequence = ''
            else:
                sequence += line
        if header: # Yield the last sequence in the file
            yield header, sequence

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    fasta_file = 'example.fasta' # Assume this file exists
    # Create a dummy fasta file for the example
    with open(fasta_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write('>gene1 description of gene1\n')
        f.write('ATGCATGCATGC\n')
        f.write('GATTACAGATTACA\n')
        f.write('>gene2 description of gene2\n')
        f.write('CGTACGTACGTACG\n')

    for header, sequence in parse_fasta(fasta_file):
        print(f'Header: {header}')
        print(f'Sequence: {sequence}')
        print(f'Sequence Length: {len(sequence)}\n')

```

This script demonstrates key Python concepts: functions, file handling, loops, and string manipulation. During the hands-on session, you will write and run this script, and we will explore how to modify it to perform other tasks, such as calculating GC content or searching for specific motifs in the sequences.

By the end of Day 2, you will have a foundational understanding of how to automate bioinformatics workflows using both Bash and Python, with a practical focus on parsing one of the most common data formats in genomics.




### Day 3: Sequence Alignment and Dot Plot Analysis (using R)

Day 3 will delve into the fundamental concepts of biological sequences and their comparison. Understanding DNA, RNA, and protein sequences is paramount in bioinformatics, as they are the raw data for most analyses. We will then explore how to visualize sequence similarities and differences using dot plot analysis, with a hands-on session in R.

**Morning Session: Basics of DNA, RNA, and Protein Sequences**

This session will provide a foundational understanding of the different types of biological sequences and their significance in molecular biology and genomics.

**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): The Blueprint of Life**

*   **Structure:** DNA is a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).
*   **Base Pairing:** A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G (Chargaff's rules). This complementary base pairing is crucial for DNA replication and repair.
*   **Function:** DNA carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. It serves as the long-term storage of genetic information.
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** DNA sequences are typically represented as strings of A, T, C, G characters.

**RNA (Ribonucleic Acid): The Messenger and More**

*   **Structure:** RNA is typically single-stranded and contains ribose sugar instead of deoxyribose. It has Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T), so A pairs with U, and C pairs with G.
*   **Types and Functions:**
    *   **mRNA (messenger RNA):** Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis.
    *   **tRNA (transfer RNA):** Carries specific amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.
    *   **rRNA (ribosomal RNA):** A structural component of ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs.
    *   **Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs):** A diverse group of RNAs with regulatory and catalytic functions (e.g., microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs).
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** RNA sequences are represented as strings of A, U, C, G characters.

**Proteins: The Workhorses of the Cell**

*   **Structure:** Proteins are complex macromolecules made up of chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. There are 20 common amino acids, each with a unique side chain.
*   **Levels of Structure:** Proteins fold into specific three-dimensional structures (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) that determine their function.
*   **Function:** Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions (enzymes), DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules.
*   **Representation in Bioinformatics:** Protein sequences are represented as strings of single-letter amino acid codes (e.g., A for Alanine, L for Leucine).

**The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology:**

DNA -> RNA -> Protein. This fundamental concept describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. Bioinformatics plays a critical role in analyzing and understanding each step of this process.

**Afternoon Session: Dot Plot Analysis for Sequence Comparisons (Hands-on in R)**

Dot plot analysis is a simple yet powerful graphical method for comparing two biological sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) to identify regions of similarity, repeats, inversions, and deletions. It provides a visual representation of sequence alignment without performing a full, computationally intensive alignment.

**How Dot Plots Work:**

A dot plot is a two-dimensional matrix where one sequence is plotted along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis. A dot is placed at coordinates (i, j) if the character at position `i` in the x-axis sequence matches the character at position `j` in the y-axis sequence. Regions of similarity appear as diagonal lines.

*   **Perfect Match:** A single, continuous diagonal line.
*   **Repeats:** Multiple parallel diagonal lines.
*   **Inversions:** Diagonal lines perpendicular to the main diagonal.
*   **Insertions/Deletions:** Shifts or breaks in the diagonal lines.

**Hands-on Practice in R:**

R is a powerful statistical programming language widely used in bioinformatics for data analysis and visualization. We will use R to create dot plots and interpret their patterns.

**Required R Packages:**

We will likely use packages such as `seqinr` or `Biostrings` for sequence manipulation and base R plotting functions, or `ggplot2` for more advanced visualizations.

**Example R Code for Dot Plot Analysis:**

First, ensure you have R and RStudio (optional, but recommended for a user-friendly interface) installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

```R
# Install necessary packages if you haven't already
install.packages("seqinr")
# If using Bioconductor packages, you might need:
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#     install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install("Biostrings")

library(seqinr)
# library(Biostrings) # Uncomment if using Biostrings

# Define two example sequences
seq1 <- "ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTASemiconductor manufacturing is a complex process involving hundreds of steps. It is often described as a series of layers built upon a silicon wafer. These layers are patterned and etched to create the intricate circuits that make up a microchip. The process requires extreme precision and cleanliness, as even the smallest particle can cause a defect. The main steps involved are:  1. Wafer preparation: Silicon ingots are sliced into thin wafers, which are then polished to a mirror-like finish.  2. Oxidation: A layer of silicon dioxide (an insulator) is grown on the wafer surface.  3. Photoresist application: A light-sensitive material (photoresist) is applied to the wafer.  4. Exposure and development: The photoresist is exposed to UV light through a mask, transferring the circuit pattern. The exposed (or unexposed, depending on the photoresist type) areas are then removed.  5. Etching: Unprotected areas of the underlying layer are removed using chemical etchants or plasma.  6. Ion implantation: Dopants (impurities) are introduced into specific areas of the silicon to alter its electrical properties, creating transistors and other components.  7. Deposition: Thin films of various materials (conductors, insulators, semiconductors) are deposited onto the wafer using techniques like Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) or Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD).  8. Planarization: The wafer surface is smoothed after deposition and etching steps to ensure subsequent layers are flat.  9. Metallization: Layers of metal (usually copper or aluminum) are deposited and patterned to form interconnections between components.  10. Testing and packaging: Individual chips on the wafer are tested, cut, and packaged into their final forms.  This entire process is repeated multiple times, with different masks and materials, to build up the complex 3D structure of a modern integrated circuit. Each step is critical, and precise control over temperature, pressure, chemical concentrations, and particle contamination is essential for high yields and reliable performance.  What specific aspect of semiconductor manufacturing would you like to know more about? Or perhaps you have a question about one of these steps?  




### Day 4: Biological Databases, Genomic Data Formats, and Data Retrieval

Day 4 focuses on the vast and indispensable world of biological databases. These repositories store an immense amount of biological information, from raw sequence data to annotated genes, proteins, and even disease-related information. Learning how to effectively query and retrieve data from these databases is a fundamental skill for any bioinformatician.

**Biological Databases: The Information Hubs of Biology**

Biological databases are organized collections of biological data, often made publicly available to researchers worldwide. They are crucial for storing, organizing, and providing access to the ever-growing volume of biological information generated by high-throughput technologies. These databases can be broadly categorized into:

*   **Primary Databases:** Store raw experimental data (e.g., DNA sequences from sequencing projects, protein structures from crystallography). Examples include GenBank (for nucleotide sequences), UniProt (for protein sequences and functional annotation), and PDB (Protein Data Bank for 3D protein structures).
*   **Secondary Databases:** Contain analyzed, annotated, and curated data derived from primary databases. They often integrate information from multiple sources and provide higher-level insights (e.g., KEGG for pathways, Pfam for protein families).
*   **Specialized Databases:** Focus on specific types of data or organisms (e.g., Ensembl for eukaryotic genomes, NCBI Gene for gene-specific information).

**Key Genomic Data Formats**

Beyond FASTA (which we covered on Day 2), several other formats are commonly encountered when working with genomic data:

*   **FASTQ:** Stores raw sequencing reads, including both the sequence and its associated quality scores. This is the primary output format from next-generation sequencing machines.
    *   Example: `@SEQ_ID
    GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAATCACAGGCAGTAGCTGCGAAGCG
    +
    !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''
    `
*   **SAM/BAM:** Sequence Alignment/Map format. Stores sequence alignments to a reference genome. SAM is text-based, while BAM is its compressed binary equivalent. They contain information about read name, flag, reference sequence name, mapping position, mapping quality, CIGAR string (describing alignment), mate information, and sequence/quality.
*   **VCF (Variant Call Format):** Stores information about genetic variations (SNPs, indels) found in a sample relative to a reference genome. It includes chromosome, position, ID, reference allele, alternative allele, quality, filter, and format information.
    *   Example: `#CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT SAMPLE
    1 100 . A G 50 PASS . GT 0/1
    `
*   **GFF/GTF (General Feature Format/Gene Transfer Format):** Used to describe genomic features (genes, exons, CDS, etc.) and their locations on a reference sequence.

**Data Retrieval: Accessing Biological Information**

There are several ways to retrieve data from biological databases:

1.  **Web Interfaces:** Most databases provide user-friendly web interfaces for browsing and searching. This is good for interactive exploration and retrieving small amounts of data.
2.  **Programmatic Access (APIs):** Many databases offer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow users to write scripts (e.g., in Python or R) to automatically query and download data. This is ideal for large-scale or automated data retrieval.
3.  **Specialized Command-Line Tools:** Tools like Entrez Direct (part of NCBI E-utilities) provide powerful command-line access to NCBI databases.

**Hands-on Database Querying and Use of Tools like Entrez Direct**

In this hands-on session, we will focus on using Entrez Direct (E-utilities) to query and retrieve data from NCBI databases. Entrez Direct is a suite of command-line tools that allows you to access data from various NCBI databases (PubMed, GenBank, SRA, etc.) directly from your terminal. This is incredibly powerful for automating data retrieval workflows.

**Key Entrez Direct Commands:**

*   `esearch`: Searches an NCBI database for a term and returns a list of UIDs (unique identifiers).
*   `efetch`: Retrieves records from an NCBI database based on UIDs.
*   `elink`: Finds related UIDs in other databases.
*   `einfo`: Displays information about NCBI databases.

**Example Workflow: Retrieving a Gene Sequence from GenBank**

Let's say we want to retrieve the nucleotide sequence for the human TP53 gene from GenBank.

1.  **Search for the gene in the `gene` database:**
    ```bash
    esearch -db gene -query 


"human TP53" | esummary
    ```
    This will give you a summary of the gene entry, including its GeneID.

2.  **Use the GeneID to search in the `nuccore` (nucleotide) database and fetch the sequence in FASTA format:**
    ```bash
    esearch -db gene -query "human TP53" | elink -db nuccore -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta > TP53_gene.fasta
    ```
    This command chain does the following:
    *   `esearch -db gene -query "human TP53"`: Searches the `gene` database for "human TP53".
    *   `elink -db nuccore -target nuccore`: Links the results to the `nuccore` database.
    *   `efetch -format fasta`: Fetches the linked records in FASTA format.
    *   `> TP53_gene.fasta`: Redirects the output to a file named `TP53_gene.fasta`.

**Hands-on Exercises:**

*   Retrieve the protein sequence for a specific gene from UniProt using `esearch` and `efetch`.
*   Download a set of SRA (Sequence Read Archive) accession numbers for a given study.
*   Explore different output formats for `efetch` (e.g., `xml`, `gb`).
*   Combine `grep` and `awk` with `efetch` to extract specific information from fetched records.

By the end of Day 4, you will be proficient in navigating and extracting valuable biological data from public databases using command-line tools, a skill that is indispensable for any bioinformatics project.

### Day 5: Data QC, Experimental Design, and Review

Day 5 is crucial for understanding the importance of data quality in bioinformatics and how experimental design impacts downstream analysis. We will also have a challenging hands-on session to apply our Linux and HPC knowledge.

**Morning Session 1: Integrative Discussion on Experimental Design and Its Impact on SNP Analysis and RNA-seq**

Before diving into data analysis, it is paramount to understand the principles of good experimental design. A well-designed experiment ensures that the data collected is robust, reliable, and capable of answering the biological questions posed. Poor experimental design can lead to biased results, false conclusions, and wasted resources.

**Key Principles of Experimental Design in Genomics:**

*   **Replication:** Having multiple biological replicates is essential to account for biological variability and to ensure statistical power. Without sufficient replicates, it's impossible to distinguish true biological effects from random noise.
*   **Randomization:** Randomly assigning samples to experimental groups or processing order helps to minimize systematic bias.
*   **Blinding:** If possible, blinding researchers to the experimental conditions can prevent unconscious bias during data collection or analysis.
*   **Controls:** Including appropriate positive and negative controls is vital to validate experimental procedures and interpret results correctly.
*   **Sample Size Calculation:** Determining the appropriate number of samples needed to detect a statistically significant effect, considering factors like effect size, variability, and desired statistical power.

**Impact on SNP Analysis:**

For SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) analysis, experimental design considerations include:

*   **Population Structure:** Understanding the genetic relationships within your sample population is critical to avoid spurious associations. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help identify population structure.
*   **Relatedness:** Accounting for relatedness among individuals in a study is important to prevent false positives in association studies.
*   **Coverage:** Sufficient sequencing depth (coverage) is needed to accurately call SNPs and distinguish true variants from sequencing errors.
*   **Allele Frequency:** Rare variants require larger sample sizes to achieve statistical significance.

**Impact on RNA-seq:**

For RNA-seq (RNA sequencing), experimental design considerations include:

*   **Biological vs. Technical Replicates:** Biological replicates (different biological samples under the same condition) are essential for statistical inference. Technical replicates (re-sequencing the same sample) are less critical with modern sequencing technologies but can help assess technical variability.
*   **Sequencing Depth:** Adequate sequencing depth is required to accurately quantify gene expression, especially for lowly expressed genes.
*   **Batch Effects:** Samples processed at different times or by different personnel can introduce systematic biases (batch effects). Randomizing samples across batches or accounting for batch effects during analysis is crucial.
*   **RNA Quality:** The quality of input RNA significantly impacts RNA-seq results. RNA integrity (e.g., RIN score) should be assessed.

**Discussion Points:**

*   Share examples of good and bad experimental designs you have encountered.
*   Discuss the challenges of experimental design in real-world biological research.
*   How can bioinformatics tools help identify issues related to experimental design post-data collection?

**Morning Session 2: Quality Control Tools (e.g., FastQC, MultiQC, Trimmomatic)**

Once raw sequencing data is generated, the first critical step is Quality Control (QC). QC assesses the quality of the raw reads and identifies potential issues that could affect downstream analysis. Poor quality data can lead to inaccurate alignments, incorrect variant calls, and misleading expression quantification.

**FastQC:**

FastQC is a widely used tool for performing quality control checks on raw sequencing data (FASTQ files). It generates a comprehensive report with various modules that highlight potential problems in your data, such as:

*   **Per base sequence quality:** Shows the quality scores across each position in the reads.
*   **Per sequence quality scores:** Distribution of average quality scores over all reads.
*   **Per base sequence content:** Checks for biases in nucleotide composition at each position.
*   **Per sequence GC content:** Distribution of GC content across all reads.
*   **Sequence Length Distribution:** Shows the distribution of read lengths.
*   **Overrepresented sequences:** Identifies sequences that appear unusually frequently, often indicating contamination or adapter sequences.
*   **Adapter content:** Detects the presence of common sequencing adapter sequences.

**MultiQC:**

MultiQC is a powerful tool that aggregates results from multiple bioinformatics analysis tools (including FastQC, but also aligners, variant callers, etc.) into a single, interactive HTML report. This makes it incredibly easy to get a quick overview of the quality and success of your entire workflow across many samples. Instead of opening dozens of individual FastQC reports, MultiQC consolidates them into one summary.

**Trimmomatic:**

Trimmomatic is a flexible and high-performance tool for trimming and cropping Illumina (and other) sequencing reads. It is used to remove low-quality bases, adapter sequences, and short reads that can negatively impact alignment and downstream analysis. Common trimming operations include:

*   **ILLUMINACLIP:** Removes adapter sequences.
*   **LEADING/TRAILING:** Removes low-quality bases from the start/end of reads.
*   **SLIDINGWINDOW:** Performs a sliding window quality trim.
*   **MINLEN:** Removes reads shorter than a specified length.

**Workflow Example: QC and Trimming**

1.  **Run FastQC on raw FASTQ files:**
    ```bash
    fastqc raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz -o fastqc_reports
    ```
2.  **Run Trimmomatic to clean reads:**
    ```bash
    java -jar /path/to/trimmomatic.jar PE -phred33 \
        raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz \
        trimmed_R1_paired.fastq.gz trimmed_R1_unpaired.fastq.gz \
        trimmed_R2_paired.fastq.gz trimmed_R2_unpaired.fastq.gz \
        ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36
    ```
    *Note: Replace `/path/to/trimmomatic.jar` and `adapters.fa` with actual paths.*

3.  **Run FastQC again on trimmed reads to assess improvement:**
    ```bash
    fastqc trimmed_R1_paired.fastq.gz trimmed_R2_paired.fastq.gz -o fastqc_trimmed_reports
    ```
4.  **Run MultiQC to summarize all FastQC reports:**
    ```bash
    multiqc fastqc_reports fastqc_trimmed_reports -o multiqc_summary
    ```

**Afternoon Session: Linux & Apocrita [Queen Mary’s HPC] Hands-on Challenge**

This session will be a practical challenge where you will apply your accumulated Linux command-line skills and get a taste of working in an HPC environment. We will use a simulated or actual HPC environment (like Queen Mary University of London's Apocrita cluster, if access is provided and configured) to perform a basic bioinformatics task, emphasizing job submission and resource management.

**HPC Environment Overview (Apocrita Example):**

This knowledge will be essential as we move into more applied genomic analyses in Week 2.




## Week 2: Applied Bioinformatics for Genomics and Breeding

### Day 6: SNP Calling, Variant Processing, and Phylogenetics

Week 2 shifts our focus to applied bioinformatics, specifically in the context of genomics and breeding. Day 6 will introduce you to Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), their detection (SNP calling), processing variant data, and how to use genetic variation to understand evolutionary relationships through phylogenetics.

**Morning Session 1: Understanding SNPs and DArT markers (RAN to provide an introduction of Verdant Tag Panel)**

**Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs):**

SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation among individuals. A SNP occurs when a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) in the genome differs between members of a species or paired chromosomes in an individual. For example, at a specific position in the genome, one individual might have an 'A' while another has a 'G'.

*   **Significance:** SNPs are crucial genetic markers used in various applications:
    *   **Disease Association:** Identifying SNPs associated with disease susceptibility or resistance.
    *   **Pharmacogenomics:** Predicting an individual's response to drugs.
    *   **Population Genetics:** Studying genetic diversity and evolutionary history.
    *   **Plant and Animal Breeding:** Marker-assisted selection for desirable traits.
*   **Frequency:** To be considered a SNP, the variation must be present in at least 1% of the population.

**DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology) markers:**

DArT is a high-throughput genotyping platform used to discover and score thousands of genetic markers (often SNPs and presence/absence variations) across a genome. It is particularly useful for species with complex genomes or without a reference genome. DArT markers are often used in breeding programs for genetic mapping, diversity analysis, and marker-assisted selection.

*   **Verdant Tag Panel (RAN to provide introduction):** This refers to a specific DArT marker panel, likely optimized for certain plant species or breeding objectives. The trainer (RAN) will provide specific details on its application and utility.

**Morning Session 2: SNP Calling and Annotation (e.g., GATK, Stacks, bcftools, VCFtools, SnpEff)**

SNP calling is the process of identifying genetic variations (SNPs and small insertions/deletions, or indels) from sequencing data. This typically involves aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome and then identifying positions where the observed nucleotides differ from the reference.

**General SNP Calling Workflow:**

1.  **Read Alignment:** Align raw sequencing reads (FASTQ) to a reference genome (e.g., using BWA, Bowtie2) to produce BAM files.
2.  **Variant Discovery:** Identify potential variant sites based on discrepancies between reads and the reference.
3.  **Variant Genotyping:** Determine the genotype (e.g., homozygous reference, heterozygous, homozygous alternative) at each variant site for each sample.
4.  **Variant Filtering:** Apply filters to remove low-quality or artifactual variants.

**Common Tools for SNP Calling:**

    *   **GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit):** A widely used, industry-standard suite of tools for variant discovery and genotyping, particularly for human genome data. It includes best practices workflows for germline and somatic variant calling.
        *   Key steps in GATK best practices: Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR), Indel Realignment, HaplotypeCaller (for variant discovery), GenotypeGVCFs (for joint genotyping).
        ```bash
        # Example GATK workflow (conceptual, requires Java and GATK installed)
        # 1. Index reference genome (if not already done)
        # samtools faidx reference.fasta
        # java -jar picard.jar CreateSequenceDictionary R=reference.fasta O=reference.dict

        # 2. HaplotypeCaller for variant discovery (per sample)
        # gatk HaplotypeCaller -R reference.fasta -I aligned_reads.bam -O raw_variants.g.vcf.gz -ERC GVCF

        # 3. CombineGVCFs (if multiple samples)
        # gatk CombineGVCFs -R reference.fasta -V sample1.g.vcf.gz -V sample2.g.vcf.gz -O combined.g.vcf.gz

        # 4. GenotypeGVCFs (joint genotyping)
        # gatk GenotypeGVCFs -R reference.fasta -V combined.g.vcf.gz -O raw_variants.vcf.gz

        # 5. Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) - for large datasets
        # gatk VariantRecalibrator -R reference.fasta -V raw_variants.vcf.gz ... -O recal.tranches
        # gatk ApplyVQSR -R reference.fasta -V raw_variants.vcf.gz ... -O final_variants.vcf.gz
        ```
    *   **Stacks:** A software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences, particularly useful for SNP discovery and genotyping in populations without a reference genome (de novo assembly) or with a reference (reference-based assembly).
        ```bash
        # Example Stacks workflow (conceptual)
        # 1. Process_radtags (demultiplexing and quality filtering)
        # process_radtags -f raw_reads.fastq -o ./output_dir -b barcodes.txt -e sbfI -r -c -q -t 90 --inline_null

        # 2. Ustacks (de novo assembly of loci within individuals)
        # ustacks -f sample_1.fq -o ./output_dir -i 1 -m 3 -M 2 -p 4

        # 3. Cstacks (build catalog of loci across individuals)
        # cstacks -b 1 -P ./output_dir -s sample1 -s sample2 -s sampleN

        # 4. Sstacks (match samples to catalog)
        # sstacks -b 1 -P ./output_dir -s sample1 -s sample2 -s sampleN

        # 5. Gstacks (genotype individuals from aligned reads)
        # gstacks -b 1 -P ./output_dir -t 4

        # 6. Populations (filter and export VCF)
        # populations -P ./output_dir -M popmap.txt -r 0.8 --vcf
        ```
    *   **bcftools:** A suite of command-line utilities for manipulating and analyzing VCF (Variant Call Format) files. It can be used for filtering, merging, and comparing VCF files, as well as for basic variant calling.
        ```bash
        # Example bcftools variant calling workflow
        # 1. Align reads (e.g., with BWA) and sort/index BAM (as shown in Hands-on section)

        # 2. Call variants using mpileup and call
        bcftools mpileup -Ou -f reference.fasta aligned_reads.sorted.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ov -o variants.vcf

        # 3. Filter variants (example: remove low quality variants)
        bcftools view -i 'QUAL>20 && FORMAT/DP>10' variants.vcf -o filtered_variants.vcf
        ```
    *   **VCFtools:** Another set of command-line tools for working with VCF files, offering functionalities for filtering, statistics, and format conversion.
        ```bash
        # Example VCFtools usage (filtering and statistics)
        # Filter variants by minor allele frequency (MAF) and missing data
        vcftools --vcf variants.vcf --maf 0.05 --max-missing 0.8 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out filtered_by_maf_missing

        # Calculate SNP diversity (pi)
        vcftools --vcf filtered_variants.vcf --site-pi --out site_pi
        ```

**SNP Annotation:**

Once SNPs are called, they need to be annotated to understand their potential functional impact. Annotation involves determining if a SNP is in a gene, what type of change it causes (e.g., synonymous, non-synonymous, stop-gain), and if it has been previously reported in databases.

*   **SnpEff:** A popular tool for annotating genetic variants. It predicts the effect of variants on genes and proteins (e.g., missense, nonsense, frameshift) and can integrate with various databases.
    ```bash
    # Example SnpEff workflow
    # 1. Download and build the SnpEff database for your organism (e.g., for human GRCh38)
    # java -jar snpEff.jar download GRCh38

    # For custom genome/annotation (requires GTF/GFF3 and FASTA)
    # Create a snpEff.config file pointing to your genome and annotation
    # java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v your_organism_database

    # 2. Annotate your VCF file
    java -jar snpEff.jar your_organism_database filtered_variants.vcf > annotated_variants.vcf
    ```

**Afternoon Session 3: Hands-on Practice: SNP Calling Workflow**

In this hands-on session, we will perform a simplified SNP calling workflow using a small dataset. We will focus on practical application of some of the tools discussed.

**Example Workflow Steps (using a subset of tools):**

1.  **Reference Genome Preparation:** Indexing the reference genome for alignment.
    ```bash
    bwa index reference.fasta
    samtools faidx reference.fasta
    java -jar picard.jar CreateSequenceDictionary R=reference.fasta O=reference.dict
    ```
2.  **Read Alignment (e.g., BWA-MEM):**
    ```bash
    bwa mem reference.fasta raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz | samtools view -bS - > aligned_reads.bam
    ```
3.  **Sort and Index BAM:**
    ```bash
    samtools sort aligned_reads.bam -o aligned_reads.sorted.bam
    samtools index aligned_reads.sorted.bam
    ```
4.  **Variant Calling (e.g., bcftools):**
    ```bash
    bcftools mpileup -Ou -f reference.fasta aligned_reads.sorted.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ov -o variants.vcf
    ```
5.  **Variant Filtering (e.g., VCFtools):**
    ```bash
    vcftools --vcf variants.vcf --remove-filtered-all --min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out filtered_variants
    ```
6.  **Variant Annotation (e.g., SnpEff):**
    ```bash
    # First, download and build the SnpEff database for your organism
    # java -jar snpEff.jar download GRCh38 # Example for human
    java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v your_organism_database # For custom database
    java -jar snpEff.jar your_organism_database filtered_variants.recode.vcf > annotated_variants.vcf
    ```

**Afternoon Session 4: Hands-on: Constructing Phylogenetic Trees**

Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms (or genes) through time. Phylogenetic trees are diagrams that depict these relationships. They are constructed based on genetic (or morphological) data, often using sequence variations like SNPs.

**Key Concepts in Phylogenetics:**

*   **Taxa/OTUs:** The operational taxonomic units (e.g., species, individuals, genes) at the tips of the branches.
*   **Nodes:** Represent common ancestors.
*   **Branches:** Represent evolutionary lineages.
*   **Root:** The common ancestor of all taxa in the tree (if rooted).
*   **Clade:** A group of organisms that includes an ancestor and all of its descendants.

**Methods for Tree Construction:**

*   **Distance-based methods (e.g., Neighbor-Joining):** Calculate genetic distances between sequences and then build a tree based on these distances.
*   **Parsimony methods:** Find the tree that requires the fewest evolutionary changes (mutations) to explain the observed data.
*   **Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods:** Find the tree that maximizes the probability of observing the given data under a specific evolutionary model.
*   **Bayesian methods:** Use Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior probability of trees.

**Hands-on Practice with Phylogenetic Tools:**

We will use a set of aligned sequences (e.g., from a multi-sample VCF converted to FASTA) and apply tools to construct and visualize phylogenetic trees.

**Tools (examples):**

    *   **MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis):** A user-friendly software for sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and evolutionary analysis. (Often GUI-based, but command-line versions or specific modules can be used).
    *   **RAxML/IQ-TREE:** Popular command-line tools for maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference, known for their speed and accuracy.
        ```bash
        # Example RAxML-NG workflow (conceptual)
        # 1. Prepare input alignment (e.g., FASTA format)
        # 2. Run RAxML-NG for tree inference and bootstrapping
        raxml-ng --msa input_alignment.fasta --model GTR+G --prefix T1 --threads 4 --bs-trees 100
        # --msa: input multiple sequence alignment
        # --model: evolutionary model (e.g., GTR+G for nucleotides)
        # --prefix: output file prefix
        # --threads: number of CPU threads
        # --bs-trees: number of bootstrap replicates
        ```
    *   **FastTree:** A fast algorithm for constructing approximate maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from large alignments.
        ```bash
        # Example with FastTree (assuming input.fasta is your aligned sequence file)
        FastTree -gtr -nt input.fasta > tree.nwk
        # -gtr: General Time Reversible model (for nucleotide data)
        # -nt: Specifies nucleotide data
        # tree.nwk: Output tree in Newick format
        ```
    *   **FigTree/iTOL:** Tools for visualizing and annotating phylogenetic trees.

**Example Workflow (Conceptual):**

1.  **Prepare Input Data:** Convert your VCF file (containing SNPs from multiple samples) into a format suitable for phylogenetic analysis (e.g., FASTA alignment). This often involves custom scripting or tools like `vcf2phylip`.
    ```bash
    # Conceptual step: Convert VCF to FASTA alignment for phylogenetic analysis
    # This often requires a custom script or tool like vcf2phylip.py
    # python vcf2phylip.py -i your_variants.vcf -o alignment.phy
    # Or for simple FASTA from VCF (for SNP sites only):
    # bcftools query -f ">[%SAMPLE\t%REF%ALT]\n" your_variants.vcf | sed 's/\t//g' > alignment.fasta
    ```
2.  **Run Tree Construction:** Execute a phylogenetic program.
    ```bash
    # Using FastTree for a quick tree
    FastTree -gtr -nt alignment.fasta > tree.nwk
    ```
3.  **Visualize Tree:** Open the `.nwk` file in a tree visualization software like FigTree or upload to iTOL.

By the end of Day 6, you will have a practical understanding of how to identify genetic variations and use them to infer evolutionary relationships, skills critical for both basic research and applied breeding programs.




### Day 7: SNP Applications in Breeding

Day 7 focuses on the practical applications of SNPs in agricultural and animal breeding. We will explore how genetic markers, particularly SNPs, are used to understand population structure, identify desirable traits, and accelerate breeding programs.

**Morning Session 1: Introduction to Breeding Needs**

This session will provide an overview of the challenges and objectives in modern breeding programs and how genomic tools, particularly SNP markers, have revolutionized the field. Traditional breeding relies on phenotypic selection, which can be slow, labor-intensive, and influenced by environmental factors. Genomic breeding aims to accelerate this process by using genetic information directly.

**Key Breeding Objectives:**

*   **Increased Yield:** Developing varieties or breeds that produce more food, fiber, or other products.
*   **Improved Quality:** Enhancing nutritional content, taste, shelf-life, or other desirable product characteristics.
*   **Disease and Pest Resistance:** Breeding for resilience against common pathogens and pests to reduce crop losses and reliance on chemical treatments.
*   **Stress Tolerance:** Developing varieties that can withstand adverse environmental conditions like drought, salinity, or extreme temperatures.
*   **Adaptation to Climate Change:** Creating resilient crops and livestock that can thrive in changing climatic conditions.
*   **Reduced Environmental Impact:** Breeding for traits that require fewer inputs (e.g., water, fertilizer) or produce less waste.

**How Genomics Addresses Breeding Needs:**

Genomic technologies, especially high-throughput SNP genotyping, provide a powerful means to:

*   **Accelerate Selection:** Identify individuals with desirable genes at an early stage (e.g., seedling stage in plants), significantly shortening breeding cycles.
*   **Increase Precision:** Select for complex traits influenced by many genes (quantitative traits) with greater accuracy.
*   **Broaden Genetic Diversity:** Efficiently manage and utilize genetic diversity from germplasm collections.
*   **Understand Genetic Architecture:** Map genes responsible for specific traits, leading to a deeper understanding of the underlying biology.
*   **Overcome Environmental Variation:** Genomic selection is less affected by environmental fluctuations compared to phenotypic selection.

**Morning Session 2: Population Structure and PCA (e.g., PLINK, SNPRelate)**

Understanding the genetic structure of a population is crucial in breeding and genetic studies. Population structure refers to the presence of subgroups within a larger population that have different allele frequencies. Ignoring population structure can lead to spurious associations in genetic studies (false positives) and inefficient breeding strategies.

**What is Population Structure?**

Population structure arises from factors like geographical isolation, limited gene flow, historical migrations, and selection pressures. It can manifest as distinct genetic clusters within a population.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Population Structure:**

PCA is a widely used statistical method to reduce the dimensionality of complex datasets while retaining most of the variation. In genomics, PCA is applied to SNP data to visualize genetic relationships among individuals and identify population structure. Individuals that are genetically similar will cluster together in a PCA plot.

*   **How it works:** PCA transforms the original SNP data into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs). The first few PCs capture the largest proportion of genetic variation in the dataset.
*   **Interpretation:** By plotting individuals based on their scores on the first two or three PCs, we can often observe distinct clusters corresponding to different populations or ancestral groups.

**Tools for Population Structure Analysis:**

    *   **PLINK:** A comprehensive open-source whole-genome association analysis toolset. It can perform various genetic data manipulations, including calculating principal components for population structure analysis.
        *   **Input:** Typically requires genotype data in PLINK binary format (BED, BIM, FAM).
        *   **Command for PCA:**
            ```bash
            # Assuming you have a PLINK binary file set (my_data.bed, my_data.bim, my_data.fam)
            plink --bfile my_data --pca --out my_pca_results
            # Output: my_pca_results.eigenvec (eigenvectors/PC scores) and my_pca_results.eigenval (eigenvalues)
            ```
        *   **Output:** Files containing eigenvector (PC scores for each individual) and eigenvalue (proportion of variance explained by each PC) information.
    *   **SNPRelate (R package):** An R package for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and population genetics. It provides functions for calculating genetic relatedness, principal component analysis, and other population genetic analyses.
        *   **Input:** GDS (Genomic Data Structure) format, which can be created from VCF files.
        *   **Example R code:**
            ```R
            library(SNPRelate)

            # Convert VCF to GDS format (if not already in GDS)
            # snpgdsVCF2GDS("input.vcf", "output.gds", method="biallelic.only")

            # Open the GDS file
            genofile <- snpgdsOpen("output.gds")

            # Perform PCA
            pca <- snpgdsPCA(genofile, num.thread=2)

            # Get sample IDs and population information (if available)
            sample.id <- read.gdsn(index.gdsn(genofile, "sample.id"))
            # pop_code <- read.gdsn(index.gdsn(genofile, "sample.annot/pop_code")) # If population info is in GDS

            # Plotting the PCA results
            plot(pca$eigenvect[,1], pca$eigenvect[,2], 
                 xlab=paste0("PC1 (", round(pca$varprop[1]*100, 2), "%)"), 
                 ylab=paste0("PC2 (", round(pca$varprop[2]*100, 2), "%)"),
                 main="PCA of SNP Data")
            # Add text labels or color by population if pop_code is available
            # text(pca$eigenvect[,1], pca$eigenvect[,2], labels=sample.id, cex=0.7, pos=3)

            # Close the GDS file
            snpgdsClose(genofile)
            ```

**Morning Session 3: Introgression and Admixture Analysis (e.g., Treemix, Dsuite)**

Introgression and admixture are evolutionary processes that involve the mixing of genetic material between previously divergent populations or species. Understanding these processes is vital for studying evolutionary history, identifying adaptive traits, and managing genetic resources in breeding.

**Introgression:** The movement of genes from one species or population into another through hybridization and backcrossing.

**Admixture:** The result of interbreeding between two or more previously isolated populations, leading to individuals with mixed ancestry.

**Tools for Introgression and Admixture Analysis:**

    *   **TreeMix:** A powerful program for inferring population trees that include migration events (gene flow/admixture). It uses allele frequency data to build a maximum likelihood tree and then adds migration edges to improve the fit of the tree to the data.
        *   **Input:** Allele frequency data (e.g., from VCF files, converted to TreeMix format using `vcf2treemix.py` or similar).
        *   **Output:** Newick tree file with migration edges, and residual plots.
        *   **Example Workflow (Conceptual):**
            ```bash
            # 1. Convert VCF to TreeMix input format (requires a script like vcf2treemix.py)
            # python vcf2treemix.py -i your_variants.vcf.gz -o treemix_input.gz

            # 2. Run TreeMix (allowing for 3 migration events)
            treemix -i treemix_input.gz -m 3 -o output_treemix

            # 3. Plot the tree (requires R and the TreeMix plotting script)
            # Rscript plot_tree.r output_treemix
            ```
    *   **Dsuite:** A suite of tools for calculating D-statistics (also known as ABBA-BABA test) and related statistics to detect introgression. D-statistics measure the excess of shared derived alleles between non-sister lineages, indicating gene flow.
        *   **Input:** VCF file.
        *   **Output:** Tables with D-statistics and Z-scores.
        *   **Example Workflow (Conceptual):**
            ```bash
            # 1. Create a population file (e.g., populations.txt) with SampleID\tPopulationName
            # 2. Run Dsuite Dtrios to calculate D-statistics for all trios of populations
            Dsuite Dtrios my_data.vcf.gz populations.txt

            # 3. Run Dsuite Dinvestigate to test for introgression from a specific outgroup
            # Dsuite Dinvestigate my_data.vcf.gz populations.txt outgroup_population
            ```

**Afternoon Session 4: GWAS and Genotype-Phenotype Association Studies (e.g., PLINK)**

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are a powerful approach to identify genetic variants (typically SNPs) that are statistically associated with a particular trait or disease. GWAS has been widely applied in human genetics, agriculture, and animal breeding to discover genetic markers linked to complex traits.

**The Principle of GWAS:**

GWAS involves scanning the entire genome for common genetic variants that occur more frequently in individuals with a particular trait (e.g., high yield, disease resistance) compared to individuals without that trait. It is based on the concept of linkage disequilibrium (LD), where alleles at different loci are inherited together more often than expected by chance.

**Steps in a GWAS:**

1.  **Phenotype Collection:** Accurate and precise measurement of the trait of interest across a large number of individuals.
2.  **Genotype Data:** High-throughput genotyping of SNPs across the genome for all individuals.
3.  **Quality Control:** Rigorous QC of both genotype and phenotype data to remove errors and biases.
4.  **Statistical Association:** Performing statistical tests (e.g., logistic regression for binary traits, linear regression for quantitative traits) to assess the association between each SNP and the trait.
5.  **Correction for Multiple Testing:** Adjusting p-values for the large number of statistical tests performed across the genome (e.g., Bonferroni correction, False Discovery Rate).
6.  **Interpretation and Follow-up:** Identifying significant SNPs and exploring their biological relevance.

**Tools for GWAS:**

    *   **PLINK:** As mentioned before, PLINK is a versatile tool for GWAS. It can perform various association tests, including basic case-control association, quantitative trait association, and more complex models incorporating covariates.
        *   **Input:** Genotype data (BED, BIM, FAM) and phenotype data (a simple text file with individual IDs and trait values).
        *   **Example Command for Quantitative Trait Association (Linear Regression):**
            ```bash
            # Assuming you have a PLINK binary file set (my_genotypes.bed, .bim, .fam)
            # And a phenotype file (my_phenotypes.txt) with FID, IID, and phenotype column (e.g., TRAIT1)
            # Example my_phenotypes.txt:
            # FID IID TRAIT1
            # Sample1 Sample1 10.5
            # Sample2 Sample2 12.3

            plink --bfile my_genotypes --pheno my_phenotypes.txt --pheno-name TRAIT1 --linear --out my_gwas_results_linear
            # --linear: Performs a linear regression association test.
            # --pheno-name: Specifies the phenotype column name if multiple are present.
            # Output: my_gwas_results_linear.assoc.linear (contains association results)
            ```
        *   **Example Command for Case-Control Association (Logistic Regression):**
            ```bash
            # Assuming phenotype file has 1 for controls, 2 for cases (or -9 for missing)
            plink --bfile my_genotypes --pheno my_phenotypes.txt --pheno-name DISEASE --logistic --out my_gwas_results_logistic
            # --logistic: Performs a logistic regression association test.
            # Output: my_gwas_results_logistic.assoc.logistic (contains association results)
            ```
        *   **Output:** Results files containing SNP information, allele frequencies, p-values, and effect sizes.
    *   **GEMMA, GCTA, TASSEL:** Other popular tools for GWAS, often offering more advanced statistical models or specific functionalities.
        *   **GEMMA (Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association):** Used for mixed model association mapping, which accounts for population structure and relatedness.
            ```bash
            # Example GEMMA workflow (conceptual)
            # 1. Prepare input files (binary PLINK format and phenotype file)
            # 2. Calculate kinship matrix
            # gemma -bfile my_genotypes -gk 1 -o my_kinship

            # 3. Run association analysis with mixed model
            # gemma -bfile my_genotypes -k output/my_kinship.cXX.txt -lmm 1 -o my_gemma_results
            ```

**Afternoon Session 5: Marker-Assisted Selection, Genomic Selection, and Prediction**

Building upon GWAS, this session will introduce advanced breeding strategies that leverage genomic information to make more efficient and accurate selection decisions.

**Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS):**

MAS involves using DNA markers (like SNPs) that are tightly linked to genes controlling desirable traits to select individuals in a breeding program. Instead of waiting for the phenotype to express, breeders can select based on the presence of the marker allele.

*   **Advantages:** Faster, more efficient, less influenced by environment, can select for traits difficult to phenotype.
*   **Limitations:** Requires markers to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the causal gene, primarily effective for traits controlled by a few major genes.

**Genomic Selection (GS) and Prediction:**

Genomic selection is a more advanced form of MAS, particularly suited for complex traits controlled by many genes with small effects. Instead of using a few major markers, GS uses all available markers across the genome to predict an individual's breeding value (Genomic Estimated Breeding Value - GEBV).

*   **Training Population:** A population of individuals that have both genotype and phenotype data. This population is used to estimate the effects of all markers across the genome.
*   **Prediction Equation:** A statistical model is built using the training population to predict GEBVs for new individuals.
*   **Selection Candidate Population:** Individuals that are genotyped but not yet phenotyped (or are too young to be phenotyped). Their GEBVs are predicted using the equation from the training population.
*   **Advantages:** More accurate for complex traits, can accelerate breeding cycles significantly, no need to identify individual causal genes.
*   **Tools:** Software like `GBLUP`, `rrBLUP` (R packages), and `AlphaSimR` (for simulation) are used for genomic prediction.

**Conceptual Workflow of Genomic Selection:**

1.  **Genotype and Phenotype Training Population:** Collect SNP data and trait data for a diverse set of individuals.
2.  **Build Prediction Model:** Use statistical methods to estimate the effect of each SNP on the trait.
3.  **Genotype Selection Candidates:** Obtain SNP data for individuals in the breeding population that need to be selected.
4.  **Predict GEBVs:** Use the established model to predict the breeding value for each selection candidate.
5.  **Select Best Individuals:** Choose individuals with the highest GEBVs for the next breeding cycle.

By the end of Day 7, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how genomic data, particularly SNPs, are applied in modern breeding programs to enhance efficiency, precision, and genetic gain. You will be familiar with key concepts like population structure, introgression, GWAS, MAS, and genomic selection.




### Day 8: Linkage Mapping, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics

Day 8 explores two distinct but increasingly interconnected areas: linkage mapping, a classical genetic approach to locate genes, and machine learning, a powerful computational paradigm with growing applications in bioinformatics.

**Morning Session 1: Introduction to Linkage Mapping and Relevant Tools**

Linkage mapping is a genetic method used to determine the relative positions of genes or genetic markers on a chromosome based on how often they are inherited together. Genes that are physically close on a chromosome are said to be 


‘linked’ and tend to be inherited together. The closer they are, the less likely they are to be separated by recombination during meiosis.

**Key Concepts in Linkage Mapping:**

*   **Linkage:** The tendency of genes or markers located on the same chromosome to be inherited together.
*   **Recombination:** The process by which genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, leading to new combinations of alleles.
*   **Recombination Frequency:** The proportion of recombinant offspring among the total offspring. It is a measure of genetic distance between two loci. A recombination frequency of 1% is defined as 1 centimorgan (cM).
*   **Linkage Map:** A map showing the relative positions of genes or markers on a chromosome, based on recombination frequencies.
*   **Mapping Population:** Specific types of populations (e.g., F2, backcross, recombinant inbred lines) generated from crosses between parents with known genetic differences, used to estimate recombination frequencies.

**Applications of Linkage Mapping:**

*   **Gene Discovery:** Locating genes responsible for traits of interest.
*   **Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS):** Providing markers for use in breeding programs (as discussed on Day 7).
*   **Genome Assembly:** Aiding in the assembly of fragmented genome sequences.

**Relevant Tools for Linkage Mapping:**

*   **JoinMap/MapDisto:** Software for constructing genetic linkage maps from molecular marker data.
*   **R/qtl:** An R package for genetic mapping of quantitative traits in experimental crosses.
*   **Lep-MAP3:** A fast and accurate linkage map construction software, particularly useful for large datasets and complex pedigrees.

**Morning Session 2: Comparison of SNP Linkage Maps (Homozygous Regions)**

This session will focus on how SNP data is used to construct and compare linkage maps, particularly in the context of homozygous regions, which are common in inbred lines or self-pollinating species.

**SNPs in Linkage Mapping:**

SNPs are ideal markers for linkage mapping due to their abundance across the genome and their biallelic nature, making them easy to score. High-density SNP arrays or sequencing data provide a rich source of markers for constructing detailed linkage maps.

**Homozygous Regions and Linkage Maps:**

In highly homozygous individuals (e.g., inbred lines), large stretches of the genome can be identical by descent. When mapping populations are derived from crosses involving such lines, these homozygous regions can simplify the analysis by reducing heterozygosity, making it easier to track parental alleles and recombination events. However, it also means less variation within these regions for mapping.

**Comparing Linkage Maps:**

Comparing linkage maps from different populations or studies can reveal:

*   **Synteny:** Conservation of gene order across different species or populations.
*   **Structural Variations:** Large-scale chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., inversions, translocations) that alter gene order.
*   **Marker Density and Resolution:** How well different maps resolve genetic distances.

**Hands-on (Conceptual):**

We will discuss the process of generating a linkage map from SNP data and how to visually compare maps using software or custom scripts. This might involve using a simulated dataset or publicly available data to demonstrate the principles.

**Morning Session 2 (Continued): Basics of Machine Learning for Bioinformatics**

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions with minimal human intervention. Its ability to handle high-dimensional, complex biological data makes it increasingly valuable in bioinformatics.

**Why Machine Learning in Bioinformatics?**

Biological data is often:

*   **High-dimensional:** Thousands of genes, millions of SNPs.
*   **Complex:** Non-linear relationships, interactions between features.
*   **Noisy:** Experimental errors, biological variability.

ML algorithms can uncover hidden patterns, build predictive models, and automate tasks that are difficult or impossible for traditional statistical methods.

**Key Machine Learning Concepts:**

*   **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data (input-output pairs) to make predictions.
    *   **Classification:** Predicting a categorical outcome (e.g., disease vs. healthy, gene function type).
    *   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous outcome (e.g., gene expression level, protein stability).
*   **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in unlabeled data.
    *   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., grouping patients by gene expression profiles).
    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features while preserving important information (e.g., PCA, t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional data).
*   **Features:** The input variables or attributes used by the ML model (e.g., SNP genotypes, gene expression values).
*   **Labels/Targets:** The output variable that the model is trying to predict.
*   **Training Data:** The dataset used to train the ML model.
*   **Testing Data:** An independent dataset used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
*   **Overfitting:** When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.

**Common ML Algorithms in Bioinformatics:**

*   **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Used for classification and regression, particularly effective for high-dimensional data.
*   **Random Forests:** Ensemble learning method for classification and regression, robust to overfitting and can handle complex interactions.
*   **Neural Networks/Deep Learning:** Powerful algorithms for complex pattern recognition, especially in image analysis (e.g., microscopy) and sequence analysis.
*   **K-Means Clustering:** A popular unsupervised algorithm for partitioning data into K clusters.

**Afternoon Session 3: Hands-on: Applying Simple ML Models to Biological Data**

In this hands-on session, we will use Python with popular machine learning libraries to apply simple ML models to biological datasets. We will focus on a classification task, such as predicting disease status based on gene expression data or classifying protein function based on sequence features.

**Required Python Libraries:**

*   **`pandas`:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **`numpy`:** For numerical operations.
*   **`scikit-learn`:** The primary library for machine learning in Python, providing implementations of various algorithms, model selection tools, and preprocessing utilities.
*   **`matplotlib`/`seaborn`:** For data visualization.

**Example Workflow: Classification of Samples based on Gene Expression**

Let's consider a simplified example where we want to classify samples as 'Disease' or 'Control' based on the expression levels of a few genes.

1.  **Load and Prepare Data:** We will start with a CSV file containing gene expression values for various samples, along with their disease status (our label).

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
    import numpy as np

    # Create a dummy dataset for demonstration
    np.random.seed(42)
    data = {
        f'gene_{i}': np.random.rand(100) * 100 for i in range(1, 11) # 10 genes
    }
    data['disease_status'] = np.random.choice(['Disease', 'Control'], 100) # 100 samples
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Simulate some gene expression differences for 'Disease' samples
    df.loc[df['disease_status'] == 'Disease', 'gene_1'] += 20
    df.loc[df['disease_status'] == 'Disease', 'gene_5'] -= 15

    df.to_csv('gene_expression_data.csv', index=False)

    # Load the dataset
    # df = pd.read_csv('gene_expression_data.csv')

    # Separate features (X) and target (y)
    X = df.drop('disease_status', axis=1)
    y = df['disease_status']

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

    print(f"Training set size: {len(X_train)} samples")
    print(f"Testing set size: {len(X_test)} samples")
    ```

2.  **Train a Machine Learning Model (Random Forest Classifier):**

    ```python
    # Initialize the model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    print("Model training complete.")
    ```

3.  **Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model:**

    ```python
    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

    print(f"\nModel Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
    print("\nClassification Report:")
    print(report)
    ```

**Hands-on Exercises:**

*   Experiment with different ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) from `scikit-learn`.
*   Explore different preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling features).
*   Discuss how to interpret feature importance from models like Random Forest.
*   Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify natural groupings in biological data.

By the end of Day 8, you will have a foundational understanding of linkage mapping principles and a practical introduction to applying machine learning techniques to solve biological problems, opening doors to advanced data analysis and predictive modeling in bioinformatics.




### Day 9: RNA-seq Data Analysis

Day 9 is dedicated to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis, a powerful high-throughput technology used to measure gene expression levels, discover novel transcripts, and identify gene fusions. We will cover the entire workflow, from experimental design and pre-processing to mapping, quantification, and differential expression analysis.

**Morning Session 1: RNA-seq Experimental Design and Pre-processing**

As discussed on Day 5, robust experimental design is critical for RNA-seq studies. This session will reiterate key design principles specific to RNA-seq and then dive into the initial steps of data pre-processing.

**Key Considerations for RNA-seq Experimental Design:**

*   **Biological Replicates:** Absolutely essential for statistical power and distinguishing true biological variation from technical noise. Aim for at least 3-5 biological replicates per condition.
*   **Sequencing Depth:** The number of reads per sample. Deeper sequencing allows for better detection of lowly expressed genes and more accurate quantification. Typical depths range from 10-50 million reads per sample, depending on the complexity of the transcriptome and research question.
*   **Read Length:** Longer reads can improve alignment accuracy, especially in regions with repetitive sequences or alternative splicing.
*   **Paired-end vs. Single-end:** Paired-end reads provide more information for alignment and transcript assembly, especially for identifying splice junctions.
*   **RNA Quality and Integrity:** High-quality RNA is crucial. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) scores are commonly used to assess RNA degradation. Degraded RNA can lead to biased results.
*   **Batch Effects:** As mentioned, samples processed at different times or by different personnel can introduce systematic biases. Randomization of samples across batches is important.

**RNA-seq Pre-processing Steps:**

After sequencing, raw RNA-seq reads (FASTQ files) need to be pre-processed to remove low-quality data and artifacts before alignment and quantification.

1.  **Quality Control (QC):** Use tools like FastQC (covered on Day 5) to assess the quality of raw reads. Look for issues like low quality scores, adapter contamination, and GC content bias.
2.  **Trimming and Filtering:** Use tools like Trimmomatic (covered on Day 5) or Cutadapt to remove adapter sequences, low-quality bases, and short reads. This step is crucial for improving alignment accuracy and reducing computational burden.

    ```bash
    # Example using Cutadapt (alternative to Trimmomatic)
    cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA -A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT \
             -o trimmed_R1.fastq.gz -p trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
             raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz
    ```

**Morning Session 2: Mapping and Quantification (e.g., STAR)**

Once reads are pre-processed, the next step is to align them to a reference genome and then quantify gene or transcript expression levels.

**Read Mapping (Alignment):**

RNA-seq reads are aligned to a reference genome to determine their genomic origin. Unlike DNA sequencing, RNA-seq reads originate from transcribed regions (exons) and often span exon-exon junctions. Therefore, specialized splice-aware aligners are required.

*   **STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference):** One of the fastest and most accurate splice-aware aligners for RNA-seq reads. It uses an uncompressed suffix array index to achieve high mapping speeds.

    **STAR Workflow:**

    1.  **Genome Indexing:** Build a STAR genome index from the reference genome FASTA file and gene annotation (GTF/GFF3).
        ```bash
        STAR --runMode genomeGenerate \
             --genomeDir /path/to/STAR_index \
             --genomeFastaFiles /path/to/reference.fasta \
             --sjdbGTFfile /path/to/annotation.gtf \
             --sjdbOverhang 100 # (ReadLength - 1)
        ```
    2.  **Read Alignment:** Align trimmed FASTQ reads to the generated index.
        ```bash
        STAR --runMode alignReads \
             --genomeDir /path/to/STAR_index \
             --readFilesIn trimmed_R1.fastq.gz trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
             --readFilesCommand zcat \
             --outFileNamePrefix sample_ \
             --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
             --outSAMunmapped Within \
             --outSAMattributes Standard
        ```

**Quantification:**

After alignment, the next step is to quantify how many reads map to each gene or transcript. This provides a measure of gene expression.

*   **FeatureCounts:** A highly efficient and flexible program for counting reads to genomic features (genes, exons, etc.) from BAM files. It is often used after STAR alignment.

    ```bash
    featureCounts -p -t exon -g gene_id \
                  -a /path/to/annotation.gtf \
                  -o gene_counts.txt \
                  sample_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
    ```
    *   `-p`: Paired-end reads.
    *   `-t exon`: Count reads mapping to exons.
    *   `-g gene_id`: Group counts by gene ID.
    *   `-a`: Path to the GTF annotation file.

**Morning Session 3: Differential Expression Analysis in R (DESeq2, edgeR)**

The ultimate goal of many RNA-seq experiments is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DEGs) between different conditions (e.g., treated vs. control, disease vs. healthy). This involves statistical modeling to account for variability and normalization.

**Normalization:**

Raw read counts cannot be directly compared between samples due to differences in sequencing depth, gene length, and RNA composition. Normalization methods adjust raw counts to make them comparable. Common methods include TPM (Transcripts Per Million), FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads), and methods used by DESeq2/edgeR.

**Differential Expression Analysis (DEA):**

DEA uses statistical models (often based on negative binomial distribution) to identify genes whose expression levels are significantly different between experimental groups.

**R Packages for DEA:**

    *   **DESeq2:** A popular Bioconductor package for differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution. It is robust to outliers and provides good control over false discovery rates.

    **DESeq2 Workflow (Conceptual):**

    1.  **Load Data:** Read gene count matrix (e.g., from FeatureCounts) and sample metadata into R.
    2.  **Create DESeqDataSet Object:** Combine counts and metadata.
    3.  **Run DESeq:** Perform normalization and differential expression testing.
    4.  **Extract Results:** Get a table of differentially expressed genes with p-values, adjusted p-values, and fold changes.
    5.  **Visualization:** Create MA plots, volcano plots, and heatmaps to visualize results.

    ```R
    # Example R code for DESeq2
    library(DESeq2)

    # Assuming 'counts_matrix' is your gene counts and 'colData' is your sample metadata
    # colData should be a data.frame with row names matching column names of counts_matrix
    # and a column indicating experimental condition (e.g., 'condition')

    # Create a dummy counts matrix and colData for demonstration
    # In a real scenario, counts_matrix would come from featureCounts output
    # and colData from your experimental design file.
    set.seed(123)
    counts_matrix <- matrix(rnbinom(n=100*6, size=10, mu=100), ncol=6)
    rownames(counts_matrix) <- paste0("gene", 1:100)
    colnames(counts_matrix) <- paste0("sample", 1:6)

    colData <- data.frame(condition = factor(c("control", "control", "control", "treated", "treated", "treated")))
    rownames(colData) <- colnames(counts_matrix)

    dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts_matrix,
                                  colData = colData,
                                  design = ~ condition)

    # Pre-filtering (optional but recommended for large datasets)
    keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
    dds <- dds[keep,]

    dds <- DESeq(dds)
    res <- results(dds)

    # Order by adjusted p-value
    res_ordered <- res[order(res$padj),]

    # Summary of results
    summary(res)

    # Plotting (e.g., MA plot)
    plotMA(res, main="MA Plot")

    # Export results
    # write.csv(as.data.frame(res_ordered), file="deseq2_results.csv")
    ```

*   **edgeR:** Another widely used Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, also based on the negative binomial distribution. It offers similar functionalities to DESeq2.

    **edgeR Workflow (Conceptual):**

    1.  **Load Data:** Read gene count matrix and sample metadata into R.
    2.  **Create DGEList Object:** Create an edgeR DGEList object from counts and group information.

### Day 9: RNA-seq Data Analysis

Day 9 is dedicated to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis, a powerful high-throughput technology used to measure gene expression levels, discover novel transcripts, and identify gene fusions. We will cover the entire workflow, from experimental design and pre-processing to mapping, quantification, and differential expression analysis.

**Morning Session 1: RNA-seq Experimental Design and Pre-processing**

As discussed on Day 5, robust experimental design is critical for RNA-seq studies. This session will reiterate key design principles specific to RNA-seq and then dive into the initial steps of data pre-processing.

**Key Considerations for RNA-seq Experimental Design:**

*   **Biological Replicates:** Absolutely essential for statistical power and distinguishing true biological variation from technical noise. Aim for at least 3-5 biological replicates per condition.
*   **Sequencing Depth:** The number of reads per sample. Deeper sequencing allows for better detection of lowly expressed genes and more accurate quantification. Typical depths range from 10-50 million reads per sample, depending on the complexity of the transcriptome and research question.
*   **Read Length:** Longer reads can improve alignment accuracy, especially in regions with repetitive sequences or alternative splicing.
*   **Paired-end vs. Single-end:** Paired-end reads provide more information for alignment and transcript assembly, especially for identifying splice junctions.
*   **RNA Quality and Integrity:** High-quality RNA is crucial. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) scores are commonly used to assess RNA degradation. Degraded RNA can lead to biased results.
*   **Batch Effects:** As mentioned, samples processed at different times or by different personnel can introduce systematic biases. Randomization of samples across batches is important.

**RNA-seq Pre-processing Steps:**

After sequencing, raw RNA-seq reads (FASTQ files) need to be pre-processed to remove low-quality data and artifacts before alignment and quantification.

1.  **Quality Control (QC):** Use tools like FastQC (covered on Day 5) to assess the quality of raw reads. Look for issues like low quality scores, adapter contamination, and GC content bias.
2.  **Trimming and Filtering:** Use tools like Trimmomatic (covered on Day 5) or Cutadapt to remove adapter sequences, low-quality bases, and short reads. This step is crucial for improving alignment accuracy and reducing computational burden.

    ```bash
    # Example using Cutadapt (alternative to Trimmomatic)
    cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA -A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT \
             -o trimmed_R1.fastq.gz -p trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
             raw_reads_R1.fastq.gz raw_reads_R2.fastq.gz
    ```

**Morning Session 2: Mapping and Quantification (e.g., STAR)**

Once reads are pre-processed, the next step is to align them to a reference genome and then quantify gene or transcript expression levels.

**Read Mapping (Alignment):**

RNA-seq reads are aligned to a reference genome to determine their genomic origin. Unlike DNA sequencing, RNA-seq reads originate from transcribed regions (exons) and often span exon-exon junctions. Therefore, specialized splice-aware aligners are required.

*   **STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference):** One of the fastest and most accurate splice-aware aligners for RNA-seq reads. It uses an uncompressed suffix array index to achieve high mapping speeds.

    **STAR Workflow:**

    1.  **Genome Indexing:** Build a STAR genome index from the reference genome FASTA file and gene annotation (GTF/GFF3).
        ```bash
        STAR --runMode genomeGenerate \
             --genomeDir /path/to/STAR_index \
             --genomeFastaFiles /path/to/reference.fasta \
             --sjdbGTFfile /path/to/annotation.gtf \
             --sjdbOverhang 100 # (ReadLength - 1)
        ```
    2.  **Read Alignment:** Align trimmed FASTQ reads to the generated index.
        ```bash
        STAR --runMode alignReads \
             --genomeDir /path/to/STAR_index \
             --readFilesIn trimmed_R1.fastq.gz trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
             --readFilesCommand zcat \
             --outFileNamePrefix sample_ \
             --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
             --outSAMunmapped Within \
             --outSAMattributes Standard
        ```

**Quantification:**

After alignment, the next step is to quantify how many reads map to each gene or transcript. This provides a measure of gene expression.

*   **FeatureCounts:** A highly efficient and flexible program for counting reads to genomic features (genes, exons, etc.) from BAM files. It is often used after STAR alignment.

    ```bash
    featureCounts -p -t exon -g gene_id \
                  -a /path/to/annotation.gtf \
                  -o gene_counts.txt \
                  sample_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
    ```
    *   `-p`: Paired-end reads.
    *   `-t exon`: Count reads mapping to exons.
    *   `-g gene_id`: Group counts by gene ID.
    *   `-a`: Path to the GTF annotation file.

**Morning Session 3: Differential Expression Analysis in R (DESeq2, edgeR)**

The ultimate goal of many RNA-seq experiments is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DEGs) between different conditions (e.g., treated vs. control, disease vs. healthy). This involves statistical modeling to account for variability and normalization.

**Normalization:**

Raw read counts cannot be directly compared between samples due to differences in sequencing depth, gene length, and RNA composition. Normalization methods adjust raw counts to make them comparable. Common methods include TPM (Transcripts Per Million), FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads), and methods used by DESeq2/edgeR.

**Differential Expression Analysis (DEA):**

DEA uses statistical models (often based on negative binomial distribution) to identify genes whose expression levels are significantly different between experimental groups.

**R Packages for DEA:**

    *   **DESeq2:** A popular Bioconductor package for differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution. It is robust to outliers and provides good control over false discovery rates.

    **DESeq2 Workflow (Conceptual):**

    1.  **Load Data:** Read gene count matrix (e.g., from FeatureCounts) and sample metadata into R.
    2.  **Create DESeqDataSet Object:** Combine counts and metadata.
    3.  **Run DESeq:** Perform normalization and differential expression testing.
    4.  **Extract Results:** Get a table of differentially expressed genes with p-values, adjusted p-values, and fold changes.
    5.  **Visualization:** Create MA plots, volcano plots, and heatmaps to visualize results.

    ```R
    # Example R code for DESeq2
    library(DESeq2)

    # Assuming 'counts_matrix' is your gene counts and 'colData' is your sample metadata
    # colData should be a data.frame with row names matching column names of counts_matrix
    # and a column indicating experimental condition (e.g., 'condition')

    # Create a dummy counts matrix and colData for demonstration
    # In a real scenario, counts_matrix would come from featureCounts output
    # and colData from your experimental design file.
    set.seed(123)
    counts_matrix <- matrix(rnbinom(n=100*6, size=10, mu=100), ncol=6)
    rownames(counts_matrix) <- paste0("gene", 1:100)
    colnames(counts_matrix) <- paste0("sample", 1:6)

    colData <- data.frame(condition = factor(c("control", "control", "control", "treated", "treated", "treated")))
    rownames(colData) <- colnames(counts_matrix)

    dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts_matrix,
                                  colData = colData,
                                  design = ~ condition)

    # Pre-filtering (optional but recommended for large datasets)
    keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
    dds <- dds[keep,]

    dds <- DESeq(dds)
    res <- results(dds)

    # Order by adjusted p-value
    res_ordered <- res[order(res$padj),]

    # Summary of results
    summary(res)

    # Plotting (e.g., MA plot)
    plotMA(res, main="MA Plot")

    # Export results
    # write.csv(as.data.frame(res_ordered), file="deseq2_results.csv")
    ```

*   **edgeR:** Another widely used Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, also based on the negative binomial distribution. It offers similar functionalities to DESeq2.

    **edgeR Workflow (Conceptual):**

    1.  **Load Data:** Read gene count matrix and sample metadata into R.
    2.  **Create DGEList Object:** Create an edgeR DGEList object from counts and group information.
    3.  **Normalization:** Perform TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) normalization.
    4.  **Estimate Dispersion:** Estimate common, trended, and tagwise dispersions.
    5.  **Fit Model and Test:** Fit a negative binomial generalized linear model and perform statistical tests for differential expression.
    6.  **Extract Results:** Get a table of differentially expressed genes.

    ```R
    # Example R code for edgeR
    library(edgeR)

    # Assuming 'counts_matrix' and 'colData' from DESeq2 example
    group <- colData$condition

    y <- DGEList(counts=counts_matrix, group=group)

    # Pre-filtering
    keep <- filterByExpr(y)
    y <- y[keep,,keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]

    # Normalization
    y <- calcNormFactors(y)

    # Estimate dispersion
    y <- estimateDisp(y)

    # Fit GLM and test for differential expression
    fit <- glmQLFit(y, design)
    qlf <- glmQLFTest(fit, coef=2) # Assuming 'conditiontreated' is the second coefficient

    # Extract results
    results_edgeR <- topTags(qlf, n=nrow(y))
    print(results_edgeR)

    # Plotting (e.g., MDS plot, MA plot)
    # plotMDS(y)
    # plotSmear(qlf, de.tags=rownames(results_edgeR$table))
    ```
