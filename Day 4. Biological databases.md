## Week 1: Foundations of Bioinformatics and Genomic Data Handling

## Day 3: Biological Databases, Genomic Data Formats, and Data Retrieval

Day 3 will focus on the vast world of biological databases, understanding common genomic data formats, and practical methods for retrieving data. Accessing and managing biological data efficiently is a cornerstone of bioinformatics.

**Biological Databases:**

Biological databases are organized collections of biological data, often made publicly available to researchers worldwide. They are essential for storing, organizing, and retrieving the ever-increasing volume of biological information generated by high-throughput technologies.

**Types of Biological Databases:**

*   **Primary Databases:** Store raw experimental data (e.g., DNA sequences, protein structures). Examples include GenBank (DNA sequences), UniProt (protein sequences and functional information), PDB (Protein Data Bank - 3D protein structures).
*   **Secondary Databases:** Contain analyzed, annotated, and curated data derived from primary databases. Examples include RefSeq (curated non-redundant sequences), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes - pathways and diseases), Pfam (protein families).
*   **Specialized Databases:** Focus on specific types of data or organisms (e.g., dbSNP for single nucleotide polymorphisms, Ensembl for vertebrate genomes, TAIR for *Arabidopsis thaliana*).

## Common Genomic Data Formats

When downloading data from databases, you’ll encounter a few **standard formats**. Each has its own structure and purpose. Understanding these is key to working with bioinformatics tools.

### FASTA Format
The most common way to store **DNA, RNA, or protein sequences**.  
- The first line starts with `>` and is the **header** (sequence ID + description).  
- The following lines are the **sequence**.  

```text
# FASTA example
>gene1 description of gene1
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
>gene2 hypothetical protein
TTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG
```

### FASTQ Format  
Stores raw reads from sequencing machines. Each entry has 4 lines:  
- `@` → sequence identifier  
- The nucleotide sequence  
- `+` → separator (optionally repeats identifier)  
- Quality scores (ASCII-encoded, one per base)  

```text
# FASTQ example
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTTAAAGGG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**
```

### GFF (General Feature Format)  
Stores genome annotations, like gene positions, exons, and regulatory features. Each row corresponds to a feature along the genome.  

Columns typically include:  
- Chromosome  
- Source  
- Feature type (gene, exon, CDS…)  
- Start and end positions  
- Strand (+/-)  
- Additional info (IDs, parent features, etc.)  

```text
# GFF example
chr1    TAIR10  gene    3631    5899    .    +    .    ID=AT1G01010
chr1    TAIR10  exon    3631    3913    .    +    .    Parent=AT1G01010
```

### VCF (Variant Call Format)  
Stores genetic variants such as SNPs, insertions, or deletions.  

The file has a header (lines starting with #) followed by variant entries with columns such as:  
- Chromosome (`CHROM`)  
- Position (`POS`)  
- Reference allele (`REF`)  
- Alternative allele (`ALT`)  
- Quality scores and filters  

```text
# VCF example
#CHROM   POS     ID      REF     ALT     QUAL    FILTER  INFO
chr1     10583   rs1     G       A       29      PASS    .
chr1     10611   rs2     C       T       67      PASS    .
```
